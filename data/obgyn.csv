E) Trauma
",C,"Vaginal foreign bodies can present in prepubertal children with genital discomfort, vulvar erythema or pruritus, vaginal discharge, or vaginal bleeding. The most common foreign body is toilet paper, but other objects such as small toy parts and coins may be inserted due to the child's curiosity and exploratory genital play. Diagnosis with visualization of the vaginal vault, saline irrigation, or examination under anesthesia may be required. Treatment requires removal of the foreign body.","Adenocarcinoma of the vagina (Choice A) may be asymptomatic or present with vaginal bleeding or a vaginal mass. The primary risk factor for its development includes exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero. However, this most commonly presents after the onset of menarche, making this patient likely too young for its development. Candidiasis (Choice B) classically presents with vaginal pruritus, vulvar erythema, and a thick, white vaginal discharge. It is caused by the overgrowth of Candida species,most commonly Candida albicans. It would be unlikely to present in a patient this young and would not commonly cause bloody vaginal discharge. Sarcoma botryoides (Choice D) refers to rhabdomyosarcoma of the vagina. It often presents during early childhood with soft nodules at the vaginal entrance that have the appearance of a cluster of grapes. It does not cause vaginal discomfort, bleeding, or foul-smelling discharge unless advanced or complicated by infection or invasion of local tissues. Trauma (Choice E) can cause vaginal bleeding in a child. Most commonly this occurs due to blunt trauma from a fall, and, less frequently, from penetrating trauma. Sexual trauma can also cause vaginal bleeding or foul-smelling discharge if a concomitant sexually transmitted infection is present. This patient has no evidence or history of obvious trauma."

G) Vasa previa
",D,"Hydatidiform moles are caused by either the fertilization of an empty egg by a single sperm followed by duplication of the paternal DNA resulting in 46 chromosomes (complete) or the dual fertilization of a normal ovum resulting in 69 chromosomes (incomplete). Maternal symptoms include first trimester vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, uterine size greater than expected for dates, and hyperemesis gravidarum or persistent nausea/vomiting, the latter related to abnormally increased human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations. The vaginal bleeding may be significant and cause anemia with associated hypotension and tachycardia (eg, hemorrhagic shock, as seen in this case). Additionally, increased concentrations of √∞-hCG can stimulate the thyroid to secrete thyroid hormone, leading to symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as","Abruptio placentae (Choice A) is a premature separation of the placenta from the uterine endometrium that occurs after 20 weeks' gestation. Presenting findings include abdominal or pelvic pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and tetanic contractions. This patient is only at 12 weeks' gestation, making abruptio placentae unlikely.

Ectopic pregnancy (Choice B) presents with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain as a result of abnormal implantation of an embryo outside of the uterine cavity, commonly in the fallopian tube. It can also present with hemodynamic instability and hemoperitoneum in the setting of rupture. However, it would not likely be asymptomatic for 12 weeks prior to causing symptoms.

Endometritis (Choice C) is an acute, typically polymicrobial, infection of the uterine endometrium. Patients typically present with fever, tenderness of the uterine fund us, and mucopurulent vaginal discharge. This patient has no uterine tenderness, fever, or mucopurulent vaginal discharge, which decreases the likelihood of endometritis as the cause of her symptoms.

Placenta accreta (Choice E) refers to the abnormal attachment of the placenta to the myometrium, rather than just the endometrium. Risk factors include prior cesarean delivery or uterine surgery, increased maternal age, and multiparity. It is typically asymptomatic until delivery, when it causes postpartum hemorrhage as a result of retained products of conception.

Uterine rupture (Choice F) occurs when the muscular wall of the uterus tears and presents with severe abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability, and loss of fetal station. Risk factors include previous cesarean delivery and induction of labor, and treatment consists of emergent laparotomy. Uterine rupture does not present spontaneously in
early pregnancy with vaginal bleeding.

Vasa previa (Choice G) is associated with placenta previa but refers specifically to the condition in which blood vessels overlie the cervical os. While commonly diagnosed on routine screening ultrasonography, symptoms of an unrecognized vasa previa include vaginal bleeding with rupture of membranes or sexual intercourse that can lead to fetal exsanguination. This patient is still early in pregnancy and her membranes remain intact, making vasa previa unlikely."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Hydatidiform mole
B) Leiomyomata uteri
C) Multiple gestation
D) Polyhydramnios
E) Incorrect dates
",C,"Multiple gestation pregnancy occurs when more than one ovum is fertilized and implants in the endometrial lining of the uterine cavity. While this can occur spontaneously, it is more common with reproductive technologies, such as ovulation-induction, intrauterine insemination, and in vitro fertilization. Clomiphene use, as in this patient, stimulates ovulation by blocking the negative feedback on gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the hypothalamus via acting as an estrogen receptor antagonist. Because it nonspecifically stimulates ovulation, more than one egg can be produced and released during an ovulatory cycle, thus possibly leading to a multiple gestation pregnancy. Multiple gestation pregnancy is most commonly diagnosed on routine prenatal ultrasonography but may be suspected earlier because of hyperemesis gravidarum secondary to increased !3-hCG concentration or a uterine size larger than expected for the current gestational age. Complications of multiple gestation pregnancy include preterm labor, intrauterine fetal growth restriction, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, and fetal malpresentation.","Hydatidiform mole (Choice A) commonly presents with persistent nausea and vomiting, first trimester vaginal bleeding, early preeclampsia, and uterine size out of proportion to expected gestational age because of an abnormal fertilization of an ovum. Pelvic ultrasonography will show diffuse echogenic structures in the uterus and bilateral ovarian theca-lutein cysts. They are precursors to malignant trophoblastic disease, such as choriocarcinoma. Assistive reproductive technologies, such as clomiphene, do not increase the risk for hydatidiform mole.

Leiomyomata uteri (Choice B) are estrogen-sensitive, benign neoplasms of the uterine myometrium that present with vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and miscarriage or infertility. The uterus will be large and irregularly shaped on physical examination. Leiomyomata uteri would not be expected to cause the persistent nausea and vomiting seen in this patient.

Polyhydramnios (Choice D) refers to an excess of amniotic fluid that is associated with fetal developmental defects that result in impaired swallowing, such as anencephaly, esophageal atresia, or duodenal atresia. Additional risk factors include maternal diabetes mellitus, maternofetal Rh incompatibility, and congenital infections. While it may cause enlargement of the uterus on physical examination, it would be unlikely to cause profound nausea and vomiting this early in pregnancy.

Incorrect dates (Choice E) may cause inaccuracies in expected uterine size and 13-hCG concentrations. Gestational age is typically determined by the patient's last menstrual period or by ultrasonography early in the pregnancy. However, incorrect dates would not explain this patient's prolonged nausea and vomiting."

",B,"Uterine inversion is a rare, life-threatening complication of childbirth. It most commonly occurs during vaginal delivery when excessive traction is applied to the umbilical cord as the placenta is being delivered. This results in inversion of the uterine fundus into the endometrial cavity, with severe cases presenting with the uterine fundus at or beyond the introitus. Risk factors include macrosomia, preeclampsia, uterine structural abnormalities, and placenta accreta, the latter of which is likely present in this patient given her history of cesarean deliveries and adherent placenta. Classically, uterine inversion presents with abdominal pain and severe vaginal bleeding. Physical examination will show absence of the fundus at the umbilicus, but rather it will be present on visual examination of the cervix and vagina. As the inverted uterus is unable to appropriately contract, uterine atony persists, and the patient is at risk for massive postpartum hemorrhage, leading to hemodynamic instability and hypovolemic shock. Treatment includes hemodynamic support and resuscitation, the administration of uterine relaxants, and immediate replacement of the uterus into its appropriate position. Delaying replacement can lead to edema and vascular congestion of the uterus, preventing further attempts at replacement. For this reason, if initial attempts are unsuccessful, emergent laparotomy should be performed.","Immediate injection of methylergonovine (Choice A), an ergot alkaloid, should be avoided. Methylergonovine is a uterotonic that is used in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony. It increases smooth muscle contraction and muscular tone, which is beneficial in uterine atony but would be detrimental in the management of uterine inversion. Because the uterus needs to remain relaxed in order to be replaced and prevent severe bleeding, uterotonics should not be administered.

Curettage of placental remnants from the visible inverted uterus (Choice C) or careful dissection of the placenta from the visible inverted uterus (Choice D) are inappropriate. This patient likely has some degree of placenta accreta, or invasion of the placenta into the myometrium, which prevents it from appropriately separating from the uterus. Placenta accreta is most commonly treated with hysterectomy to prevent further bleeding. However, leaving the uterus inverted to try to remove the placenta causes persistent uterine atony, ongoing severe postpartum hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock, and uterine edema that will prevent replacement. The uterus should be replaced as quickly as possible.

Transvaginal hysterectomy (Choice E) may be required for this patient in order to adequately remove the placenta. However, the more appropriate immediate step in the treatment of this patient is to replace the uterus into its appropriate position to minimize the risk for postpartum hemorrhage."

",C,"Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin found in a variety of foods, such as leafy green vegetables, carrots, and egg yolks. It plays an important role in the maintenance of the cornea and conjunctiva, as well as phototransduction. As such, vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness and xerophthalmia. Alternatively, vitamin A toxicity can cause nausea, vomiting, and changes in vision when the toxicity is acute, or ataxia, hepatotoxicity, and alopecia when the toxicity is chronic. However, in pregnant patients, excessive ingestion of vitamin A can lead to teratogenic effects in the fetus. These include microcephaly and cardiac defects, as well as spontaneous abortion. This patient is likely already receiving a sufficient daily dose of vitamin A with her prenatal vitamin and vegan diet and should thus decrease the other forms of her ingested vitamin A, such as the daily supplement, to avoid fetal toxicity.","Moderation of her exercise routine (Choice A) is not necessary. Overall, exercise in pregnancy is considered safe and healthy. Beginning or continuing a program of moderate intensity aerobic and strength exercises, such as this patient's yoga routine, is an appropriate recommendation. However, the patient should avoid high intensity exercises or exercises with a risk for falls (eg, gymnastics) to avoid trauma to the abdomen and fetus.

Targeted ultrasonography because of exposure to tetanus toxoid (Choice B) is not recommended. The tetanus toxoid vaccine is an inactivated vaccine that is safe to give during pregnancy and should be given without concern for risk to the pregnant patient or the fetus.

Decreasing her vitamin B1 intake (Choice D) is not necessary in this patient. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is a water-soluble vitamin that does not cause toxicity, even in excess. Deficiency can lead to beriberi or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and it is thus appropriate for this patient to continue her supplementation.

MMR vaccine (Choice E) is inappropriate in a pregnant patient, as it is a live attenuated virus. Live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnant patients as they can lead to infection of the fetus. Rubella infection of an unvaccinated pregnant patient can lead to fetal defects such as sensorineural deafness, neurodevelopmental delay, congenital cardiac defects, microcephaly, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Therefore, this patient should be vaccinated after delivery."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Amniotic fluid embolism
B) Eclampsia
C) Epilepsy
D) Hypocalcemia
E) Hyponatremia
",E,"Hyponatremia, or a serum sodium concentration less than 135 mEq/L, may be acute or chronic, with symptoms related to the severity of depletion and the duration of onset. Acute decreases in sodium concentration may lead to neurologic symptoms, such as seizure and altered mental status due to cerebral edema. Chronic hyponatremia, in contrast, leads to less severe symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, light-headedness, fatigue, and confusion. Causes of acute hyponatremia include the administration of hypotonic fluids, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), kidney dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, beer potomania, psychogenic polydipsia, and hydrochlorothiazide diuretics, among others. This patient received a significant volume of hypotonic solution, 5% dextrose in water, which likely decreased her sodium concentration. Additionally, large amounts of oxytocin can induce SIADH, with consequent water reabsorption. Patients who present with acute neurologic signs due to hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline.","Amniotic fluid embolism (Choice A) classically occurs during delivery or immediately postpartum as a result of amniotic fluid entering the maternal circulation. It typically presents with shortness of breath, altered mental status, hypoxia, and hypotension. Complications include disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, cardiovascular collapse, and maternal and/or fetal death. It would not be expected to present with an isolated seizure.

Eclampsia (Choice B) refers to the development of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with preeclampsia. Preeclampsia presents with hypertension, proteinuria, and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation due to abnormalities of the placental spiral arteries. This patient has no reported symptoms of preeclampsia, which makes hyponatremia the more likely cause of her seizure.

Epilepsy (Choice C) refers to a condition in which a patient experiences repeat seizures. It may be idiopathic, genetic, structural, or caused by a head injury. This patient has no history of previous seizures, making epilepsy unlikely.

Hypocalcemia (Choice D) commonly presents with circumoral numbness, paresthesias, and muscle cramps, although it may also be asymptomatic. In severe cases, seizures and prolongation of the QT interval can occur. However, hypocalcemia more commonly occurs because of hypoparathyroidism or kidney dysfunction, not the administration of hypotonic fluid."

",D,"Mastitis (cellulitis of the breast tissue) presents with unilateral erythematous, indurated, edematous, warm, tender breast tissue, and is frequently associated with fever. It classically occurs in breast-feeding patients (also termed lactational mastitis) as a result of nipple inoculation with cutaneous or oral flora. Nipple excoriation or fissures from breast-feeding are a strong predisposing factor for mastitis as compromise of the skin barrier facilitates passage of organisms into the tissue. Secondary risk factors include incomplete breast emptying (Choice B), relative immune compromise (Choice E) from maternal stress, malnutrition (Choice A), lack of sleep, clogged duct, prior episodes of mastitis, tight-fitting bras, and use of antifungal nipple creams. Staphylococcus aureus is a common causative pathogen;. others include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli. Lactational mastitis is treated with oral antibiotics and continuation of breast-feeding. Sequelae of lactational mastitis include early cessation of breast-feeding (due to pain) and progression to a breast abscess. A thorough history and physical examination are important to rule out inflammatory breast carcinoma, which can present similarly with unilateral breast edema, erythema, and pain, as well as a characteristic 'peau d'orange' (orange peel) appearance of the skin.","Dietary changes (Choice A) are not specifically linked to lactational mastitis, but maternal malnutrition can impair wound healing and immune response, increasing the risk for developing mastitis following nipple excoriation and inoculation. Incomplete breast emptying (Choice B) caused by infrequent feeding, milk oversupply, or a clogged duct is a risk factor for lactational mastitis, as stagnant milk can providea substrate for pathogens to grow. However, nipple excoriation, which facilitates inoculation of pathogens into the breast, is a stronger risk factor. Newborn thrush (Choice C) has not been shown to increase the risk for lactational mastitis. However, maternal use of antifungal cream on the nipples does increase the risk for developing mastitis. Relative immune compromise (Choice E) caused by maternal illness, malnutrition, stress, or fatigue can impair healing of nipple trauma and impair immune response to pathogens introduced into the nipple. However, compromise of the skin barrier via nipple excoriation facilitates pathogen entry and is a stronger risk factor."

",E,"Uterine rupture is a dangerous complication of pregnancy wherein the muscular wall of the uterus tears. Severe pain is a common initial finding. Hemodynamic instabilitycan manifest in the mother with tachycardia and hypotension, and in the fetus with late decelerations, tachycardia, bradycardia, or loss of beat-to-beat variability. If uterine rupture occurs during labor, sudden loss of fetal station is a highly suggestive finding. Fetal parts may be palpable above the fundus with Leopold maneuvers. Risk factors for uterine rupture include vaginal birth after caesarean section, multiparity, and induction of labor with prostaglandin analogues or oxytocin. Uterine rupture is treated with emergent laparotomy.","Ephedrine therapy (Choice A) can be used to treat maternal hypotension. Because fetal blood supply is dependent on maternal perfusing pressure, hypotension in the mother can be associated with bradycardia on fetal heart tracing. This patient's blood pressure is within normal limits. Additionally, ephedrine would further increase this patient's heart rate.

Magnesium sulfate tocolysis (Choice B) is used to delay preterm labor for approximately 48 hours. Magnesium sulfate therapy is also used in the treatment of preeclampsia. Tocolysis prevents the uterus from further contractions, which can inhibit cervical change in laboring patients. However, tocolysis would be ineffective in managing this patient's condition as her contractions are not the cause of the fetal bradycardia.

Terbutaline therapy (Choice C) is used to delay preterm labor and to treat oxytocin-induced uterine tachysystole, the latter of which can inhibit blood flow to the placenta and consequently the fetus. This decrease in blood supply causes fetal bradycardia. This patient's fetal bradycardia is not secondary to tachysystole or uterine contractions, making terbutaline therapy an incorrect answer.

Forceps delivery (Choice D) is often used for a prolonged second stage of labor or in the setting of fetal distress. It requires a completely dilated and effaced cervix, ruptured membranes, and an engaged fetal occiput. As this patient is not completely dilated and has had sudden loss of fetal station, laparotomy is the most appropriate next step in management."

","(qid: 0977) A 32-year-old {dem-char-1} {dem-char-2} {dem-char-3} woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 34 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department 2 hours after the sudden onset of vaginal bleeding. Her pregnancy had been uncomplicated. Examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 34-week gestation with normal tone. The fetal heart rate pattern is normal. Contractions are irregular. Over the next hour, she has increasingly severe pain with contractions. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 170/110 mm Hg. The fetal heart rate is 150 to 160/min. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL
Leukocyte count 14,000/mm3 with a normal differential
Platelet count 96,000/mm3
Serum AST 120 U/L Lactate dehydrogenase 840 U/L Urine protein 3+
Which of the following is the most likely cause of her vaginal bleeding?
A) Abruptio placentae
B) Bloody show
C) Disseminated intravascular coagulation
D) Placenta previa
E) Vasa previa
",A,"Abruptio placentae, or placental abruption, refers to the premature separation of the placenta from the uterus. It most commonly presents with vaginal bleeding, severe uterine pain, and tetanic contractions. Risk factors include preeclampsia, lower abdominal trauma, smoking, and cocaine use. Examination shows uterine tenderness to palpation and abdominal rigidity. Because of the compromised fetal blood supply, it is an obstetric emergency. Treatment includes supportive care, fluid resuscitation, emergency cesarean delivery, and Rh0(D) immune globulin if the maternal blood type is Rh(D)-negative.","Bloody show (Choice B) is a scant amount of vaginal bleeding or blood-tinged discharge that occurs several hours to 1 day prior to the onset of labor as the cervix begins to dilate and efface. This patient is having brisk bleeding associated with severe uterine pain despite irregular uterine contractions, which makes placental abruption a more likely diagnosis than bloody show.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Choice C) may present with vaginal bleeding, in addition to diffuse bleeding from other sites (eg, mouth, gums, intravenous access sites). Laboratory studies would show thrombocytopenia, prolongation of partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times, increased D-dimer concentrations, and decreased fibrinogen. In pregnant people, it is most commonly related to blood loss associated with placental abruption or postpartum hemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism, and sepsis. This patient has no other signs of bleeding and no coagulation studies to determine whether DIC is present, making placental abruption the most likely immediate cause of her vaginal bleeding.
Placenta previa (Choice D) refers to the abnormal positioning of placental tissue such that the placenta partially or completely overlies the internal cervical os. It most commonly presents with painless third trimester vaginal bleeding. Risk factors include multiparity, previous cesarean delivery, and prior dilatation and curettage. This patient has vaginal bleeding associated with severe uterine pain, making placental abruption a more likely diagnosis.
Vasa previa (Choice E) is associated with placenta previa but refers specifically to the condition in which blood vessels overlie the cervical os. Though commonly found on routine screening ultrasonography, symptoms of an unrecognized vasa previa include vaginal bleeding with rupture of membranes. Damage to the fetal blood vessels results in significant fetal hemorrhage and possible exsanguination and death. This patient has severe pain associated with her vaginal bleeding and has yet to rupture her membranes, making vasa previa a less likely diagnosis."

Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?
A) Bacterial infection
B) Fungal infection
C) Neoplasia
D) Trauma
E) Viral infection
",A,"A Bartholin abscess can occur when a Bartholin gland becomes obstructed and infected. A Bartholin gland is located on each side of the introitus at the 5-and ?-o'clock positions relative to the opening of the vagina. These glands produce secretions that lubricate the vagina. Occasionally, the ducts of these glands become obstructed, leading to a Bartholin cyst. This presents as a small area of painful, fluctuant swelling over the posterior aspect of the labium majus. With ongoing obstruction and inflammation, infection can develop, leading to a Bartholin abscess, marked by erythema and tenderness to palpation of the cyst. Abscesses are commonly polymicrobial bacterial infections with organisms originating from both the skin and enteric flora. If a single organism is identified, it is usually Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but this is not as common as a polymicrobial source. Bartholin abscesses are treated with incision and drainage, often with placement of a catheter to promote complete evacuation, and generally also with antibiotic administration.","Fungal infection (Choice B) would be unlikely to cause a Bartholin abscess. Fungal infection of the vulva is typically caused by Candida species and presents with vulvar erythema, vaginal pruritus, and a thick, white vaginal discharge. It does not cause a fluctuant mass near the introitus.

Neoplasia (Choice C) may occur on the vulva near the vaginal entrance in the setting of vulvar carcinoma. This cancer commonly presents with a pruritic patch on the vulva, rather than the large fluctuant mass found in this patient.

Trauma (Choice D) could theoretically cause a hematoma of the vulva or vagina. Hematomas classically present with a tender, fluctuant, discolored mass. This patient has no history of trauma, making a hematoma in this area less likely than a Bartholin abscess.

Viral infection (Choice E) can cause abnormalities of the vulva. For example, infection with herpes simplex virus can cause small, painful, vesicular lesions. Viral infections are not causative organisms in Bartholin abscesses."

B) Ectopic pregnancy
C) Endometrioma
D) Hydatidiform mole
E) Ovarian germ cell tumor
",A,"The corpus luteum develops from the mature follicle after the egg has ovulated during the menstrual cycle. During pregnancy, it enlarges and secretes progesterone to maintain an early pregnancy until the placenta begins to synthesize it. This enlarged corpus luteum can form a cyst, which can potentially rupture. A ruptured corpus luteum cyst classically presents with unilateral pelvic or lower abdominal pain that is sudden in onset and severe, most commonly after sexual intercourse or other physical activity. Physical examination may show a unilateral adnexal mass, which may be tender. However, if the cyst has completely collapsed, it will not be evident on physical examination. Pelvic ultrasonography will show a complex cystic mass or free fluid in the pelvis if ruptured that may include hemorrhagic components (eg, hemoperitoneum). Culdocentesis, though rarely performed, typically produces serosanguineous fluid as the corpus luteum is highly vascular. These cysts are typically managed with observation and supportive therapy.","Ectopic pregnancy (Choice B) occurs outside of the endometrial cavity, often within a fallopian tube. It is asymptomatic until large or ruptured, which presents with acute, severe abdominopelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and signs of peritoneal inflammation. It is diagnosed with 13-hCG testing and ultrasonographic evidence of an abnormally located pregnancy. This patient has an intrauterine yolk sac, making a normal intrauterine pregnancy with an associated corpus luteum cyst most likely.
Endometrioma (Choice C) is a cyst that is formed from endometrial tissue within the adnexa in a patient with endometriosis. If palpable on physical examination, it is often adherent to nearby structures. Endometriosis commonly presents with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia. This patient has no previous symptoms of endometriosis, and endometriomas do not present with acute pain, making it unlikely in this patient.
Hydatidiform mole (Choice D) commonly presents with persistent nausea and vomiting, first trimester vaginal bleeding, early preeclampsia, and uterine size out of proportion to the expected gestational age. While 13-hCG would be increased, as it is in this patient, ultrasonography would typically show diffuse echogenic structures in the uterus and bilateral ovarian theca-lutein cysts.
Ovarian germ cell tumor (Choice E) includes teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and mixed germ cell tumors. Broadly, ovarian germ cell tumors present with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and bloating; increased concentrations of hormones such as 13-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein, and lactate dehydrogenase; and a unilateral pelvic mass on physical examination. While this patient does have increased 13-hCG, this is secondary to her normal intrauterine pregnancy, rather than an ovarian germ cell tumor."

E) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
F) Pelvic inflammatory disease
",A,"Endometritis refers to inflammation or infection of the uterine lining. It may be acute or chronic, with acute endometritis most commonly being caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is characterized by inflammation of the upper genital tract and pelvis and presents with fever, abdominopelvic pain, and mucopurulent vaginal discharge, as well as cervical motion and uterine tenderness on examination. Ascending Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections are common pathogens involved in the development of PID. Chronic endometritis, in contrast, is most commonly idiopathic or inflammatory. Less common causes include pelvic radiation therapy, infection, IUDs, fibroids, and polyps. Presenting symptoms include abnormal uterine bleeding and abdominal pain, with physical examination disclosing uterine or cervical motion tenderness, although physical examination may also be unremarkable. Abnormal uterine bleeding refers to bleeding that is irregular, unpredictable, or not associated with usual menstrual signs and symptoms. If an endometrial biopsy is done for evaluation of abnormal bleeding in chronic endometritis, it will show plasma cells in the endometrium, as in this patient. Treatment of chronic endometritis is dependent on the underlying cause but may include antibiotic therapy, removal of the foreign body, or surgical excision of any intrauterine growth.","Both endometrial cancer (Choice B) and endometrial hyperplasia (Choice C) commonly present with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, although they may present with abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. If the patient is over age 45 years or has a history of prolonged estrogen exposure, this bleeding should be evaluated with an endometrial biopsy to rule out endometrial cancer. In hyperplasia, the biopsy will show an increased density of glands, mitotic cells, and atypical nuclei. In contrast, endometrial biopsy in endometrial cancer will show malignant cells with stromal invasion. Neither would present with plasma cells on biopsy.

Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (Choice D), or primary hypogonadism, often refers to premature ovarian failure. Premature ovarian failure presents in reproductive-age women with anovulation, amenorrhea, and infertility. Laboratory studies show decreased estrogen with increased follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations. It more commonly occurs in patients younger than age 40 years and would be unlikely to cause abdominal pain.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Choice E) may be the cause of anovulation or amenorrhea. In these patients, measurements of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations will be decreased. Causes include but are not limited to systemic illness, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and hypothalamic tumors. Plasma cells in the endometrium are consistent with chronic endometritis, not hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (Choice F) is a common cause of acute endometritis and presents with fever, abdominopelvic pain, and mucopurulent discharge. Physical examination commonly discloses uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness. Endometrial biopsy in the setting of PIO would show neutrophils, not plasma cells, within the endometrium."

",B,"Pregnant patients are at risk for the development of puerperal hematomas during delivery. These hematomas may occur in the vulva, vagina, or retroperitoneum. Risk factors include nulliparity, macrosomia, operative vaginal deliveries, an extended second stage of labor, bleeding diatheses, and preeclampsia. Vulvar hematomas are most commonly caused by injuries to the pudendal artery. In contrast, vaginal and retroperitoneal hematomas are caused by injuries to the uterine and hypogastric arteries, respectively. Presentations also vary, with vulvar hematomas presenting with fluctuant, painful, discolored masses, as in this patient, vaginal hematomas causing rectal pressure, and retroperitoneal hematomas exhibiting hemodynamic instability. Treatment of vulvar and vaginal hematomas is often supportive with ice packs and analgesia but may require incision and drainage. Retroperitoneal hematomas require surgical intervention.","Inferior gluteal (Choice A) artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies blood to the glutes and thighs. It may cause bleeding in the pelvis or a hematoma in the gluteal region depending on the location of injury. It does not cause vulvar hematomas.

Superior vesical (Choice C) artery is also a branch of the internal iliac artery. It supplies blood to the bladder and ureters, as well as the ductus deferens and seminal gland in men. It is unlikely to be injured in normal vaginal delivery.

Uterine (Choice D) artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies blood to the uterus. Uterine artery injuries may be caused by operative vaginal delivery. These injuries more commonly lead to vaginal, rather than vulvar, hematomas.

Vaginal (Choice E) artery supplies blood flow to the vagina in women. It arises from the internal iliac artery and anastomoses with a branch of the uterine artery. Vaginal artery injuries may cause vaginal hematomas but would be unlikely to cause a vulvar hematoma."

",E,"Secondary amenorrhea may be caused by pregnancy, menopause or premature ovarian failure, ovulatory dysfunction, abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, inadequate nutrition, chromosomal abnormalities, and thyroid disorders. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea refers to amenorrhea that occurs in the setting of increased stress or decreased energy availability, which may be secondary to inadequate nutrition or over-exercising, often in a patient with a low BMI. In order to diagnose functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, pregnancy and other pathologies should first be excluded. It is caused by a decrease in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which consequently causes irregular secretion of gonadotropin and decreased follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, ovulation, and estrogen production. Hypercortisolemia, caused by stress, may also play a role in the inhibition of GnRH.","Abnormal peripheral estrogen conversion (Choice A) is incorrect. Estrogens are converted to androgens in peripheral adipose tissue, which can occur in excess in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. However, this patient has a low BMI, indicating she has minimal peripheral adipose tissue for estrogen conversion. Decrease in serum cortisol concentration (Choice B) is incorrect. In contrast, patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea commonly have increased concentrations of cortisol, which leads to negative feedback on the release of GnRH. This then causes decreased follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations, which consequently leads to anovulation and amenorrhea. Increase in serum prolactin concentration (Choice C) can occur in hyperprolactinemia, which can cause amenorrhea due to inhibition of GnRH, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. More commonly than amenorrhea, however, it presents with galactorrhea, which this patient is not experiencing. Increase in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration (Choice D) is seen in primary hypothyroidism, which most frequently presents with fatigue, weight gain, constipation, cold intolerance, and oligomenorrhea. It may also cause infertility due to anovulation. This patient has no other signs of hypothyroidism, such as weight gain, making this an unlikely cause of her amenorrhea."

",E,"Ovarian cancer commonly presents indolently with abdominal distension, early satiety, and weight loss in postmenopausal women. Signs and symptoms of advanced disease may also include bowel obstruction with consequent nausea and vomiting, ascites, pleural effusions, and venous thromboembolism. In addition to these, physical examination may show a palpable adnexal mass on bimanual examination or lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonography is recommended to identify or characterize the responsible lesion, with concerning features including septations, cystic components, blood flow, and a heterogeneous structure. Further evaluation is completed with tumor markers, commonly serum cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), and additional imaging to determine the extent of disease. Risk factors for the development of ovarian cancer include a family history, genetic mutation (eg, BRCA), increased age, smoking, nulliparity, and pelvic radiation. Treatment includes surgical removal and chemotherapy.","Colon cancer (Choice A) is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. It is often detected on routine colonoscopy recommended for patients between age 45 and 75 years. When symptomatic, it presents with changes in stool caliber or frequency and iron deficiency anemia. It would be unlikely to present with a pelvic mass on bimanual examination.

Endometrial cancer (Choice B) commonly presents with postmenopausal bleeding or with abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. Risk factors include chronically increased estrogen concentrations, exogenous estrogen therapy, anovulation, obesity, and estrogen-secreting tumors. It would be less likely than ovarian cancer to cause ascites with associated nausea and vomiting.

Gastric cancer (Choice C) commonly presents with weight loss, epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and, occasionally, gastrointestinal bleeding. Areas of metastasis include the liver and lymph nodes, and, less commonly, the brain or lungs. It would not cause the pelvic mass seen in this patient.

Lymphoma (Choice D) presents with weight loss, fevers, and night sweats in the setting of lymphadenopathy, with additional symptoms based on tumor location. It does not typically present with a pelvic mass."

C) Vitamin B12 deficiency
D) Sickle cell disease
E) Thalassemia
",A,"Folic acid deficiency is a cause of megaloblastic anemia that is common in pregnancy as a result of increased folic acid requirements, especially when accompanied by malnutrition. Other causes include alcohol use disorder, malabsorption, and the use of antifolate medications. The anemia is caused by impaired DNA synthesis in the red blood cell progenitor cells due to the absence of required cofactors. Symptoms include fatigue, pallor, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. Laboratory studies will show a decreased hemoglobin concentration, increased mean corpuscular volume, decreased reticulocyte count, and normal methylmalonic acid concentrations. White blood cell and platelet counts are generally normal. Peripheral blood smear will show hypersegmented neutrophils. Treatment requires folic acid supplementation and red blood cell transfusion, if severe. Folic acid supplementation is important for pregnant patients, as deficiency can lead to neural tube defects in the fetus. This is most significant in the first trimester, during initial organogenesis.","Iron deficiency (Choice B) is a common cause of anemia. In pregnant patients, this is typically caused by increased metabolic demand for iron. It can also be caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, malabsorption, and malnutrition. However, it is a microcytic anemia and would present with decreased mean corpuscular volume.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia. It is often caused by inadequate intake, seen in veganism and malabsorption, or pernicious anemia (Choice C). Pernicious anemia is caused by autoantibodies to intrinsic factor, which inhibit its role in vitamin B12 absorption. Mild symptoms are like those of folic acid deficiency. Severe deficiencies can present with neurologic symptoms, such as dementia or subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. However, vitamin B12 deficiency is less likely in pregnancy than folic acid deficiency.

Sickle cell disease (Choice D) is an autosomal disorder that is caused by mutations in globin genes, which results in abnormal hemoglobin that is prone to sickling under conditions of physiologic stress (eg, low oxygen tension, dehydration, infection). This sickling leads to vascular occlusion with cyclical pain crises, functional asplenia, hemolysis, and anemia. This previously healthy patient is unlikely to have sickle cell disease.

Thalassemia (Choice E) is a genetic disorder that causes ineffective erythropoiesis as a result of impaired production in alpha or beta globin proteins. It results in microcytic anemia. The severity of symptoms varies depending on whether the alpha or beta chain is affected, and how many of each respective gene are mutated. Thalassemia presents with microcytic, rather than megaloblastic, anemia."

",A,"Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare and potentially fatal complication of childbirth caused by amniotic fluid entering the maternal circulation. It most commonly occurs during delivery or in the immediate postpartum period. It typically presents with acute onset of shortness of breath, altered mental status or unconsciousness, and bilateral wheezing. Tonic-clonic seizures can also occur but are less common as an initial presenting sign. Signs of fetal distress can also occur if the fetus remains in utero at the time of occurrence. Vital signs will show tachycardia, hypoxia, and severe hypotension. The patient can quickly decompensate into cardiovascular collapse and cardiopulmonary arrest. Chest x-ray may show pulmonary edema. Treatment is generally supportive, with patients often requiring fluids or blood products and mechanical ventilation. Complications include diffuse bleeding from venipuncture sites, the vagina, or a cesarean section incision as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.","Eclampsia (Choice B) presents with hypertension, proteinuria, headache, visual changes, right upper quadrant pain, and seizures in a pregnant patient after 20 weeks' gestation, although it can also occur in the postpartum period. While tonic-clonic seizures are the hallmark of eclampsia, it would not be expected to cause the diffuse bleeding or cardiovascular collapse seen in this patient.
Hepatic rupture (Choice C) is a rare complication of HELLP syndrome, which is a microangiopathic hemolysis and intravascular coagulation that occurs in a subset of pregnant patients. HELLP syndrome most commonly presents with epigastric or right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bleeding, with further evaluation often disclosing hypertension and proteinuria. Hepatic rupture presents with abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability as a result of hemorrhage.
Intravascular release of bacterial endotoxins (Choice D) classically causes septic shock, which is a term used to refer to decreased organ perfusion that occurs from overwhelming infection. It is a form of distributive shock that is classically diagnosed with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and signs of infection on examination, as well as leukocytosis and lactic acidosis. The presentation is less abrupt (hours to days) compared with amniotic fluid embolism (minutes to hours).
Spasm in the left anterior descending coronary artery (Choice E), or coronary artery vasospasm, classically presents as substernal or left-sided chest pain that radiates to the arm or jaw, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea. It more commonly occurs in patients who smoke cigarettes or use cocaine and is more prominent at rest. It would not explain this patient's tonic-clonic seizure activity or diffuse bleeding.
Thromboembolism in the pulmonary artery (Choice F) presents with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxia, as well as hypotension if the pulmonary embolism is massive and hemoptysis if infarction has occurred. Massive pulmonary emboli can cause cardiac arrest if the obstruction is severe. However, given this patient's coagulopathy and generalized tonic-clonic seizure during labor, amniotic fluid embolism is the most likely diagnosis.
Thrombosis of cerebral veins (Choice G) has a varied clinical presentation, which includes headache, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and encephalopathy. Small cerebral ischemic insults can also occur as a result of venous blood congestion. While pregnancy is a risk factor for cerebral vein thrombosis, it would not explain this patient's other symptoms."

B) Complete procidentia
C) Urethral caruncle
D) Vaginal myoma
E) Vulvar carcinoma
",B,"Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs secondary to pelvic floor dysfunction and weakness, resulting in the herniation of abdominopelvic organs, which cause mass effect and protrusion along the vaginal wall. Complete procidentia is a severe form of POP that includes herniation of the entire anterior, posterior, and apical vaginal compartments through the introitus, such that that the patient has a degree of cystocele (bladder prolapse), rectocele (rectal prolapse), and enterocele (intestinal prolapse) caused by the descent of the pelvic organs. Additionally, all or a portion of the cervix and uterus may be visible externally at the introitus in complete procidentia. POP is more common in individuals who have had multiple childbirths, advancing age, and obesity, all of which are risk factors for pelvic floor dysfunction. These pelvic organ herniations can result in urinary, defecatory, and sexual dysfunction. Depending on the extent of herniation, other symptoms can include an external mass that may show ulceration and bleeding, as found in this patient. Diagnosis is made with a complete physical examination. Treatment includes pelvic floor exercises, vaginal pessaries, and surgical correction.","Bartholin duct cyst (Choice A) is caused by an obstruction of a Bartholin gland, one of which is located on each side of the introitus and provides secretions that lubricate the vagina. It presents with a small area of painful, fluctuant swelling over the posterior aspect of the labium majus. With ongoing obstruction and inflammation, an infection and Bartholin abscess can develop. It would not be expected to cause perineal bleeding or such a large mass at the introitus, making complete procidentia more likely.

Urethral caruncle (Choice C) most commonly presents with perineal bleeding in postmenopausal women. They can occasionally cause overflow urinary incontinence due to urethral obstruction. However, these lesions are small outgrowths on the posterior aspect of the urethra, rather than large protruding masses of the vagina.

Vaginal myoma (Choice D) is a benign tumor of the vaginal wall that may present with a palpable mass and vaginal bleeding, as found in this patient. However, these tumors are extraordinarily rare, and a complete procidentia would be significantly more likely in this patient.

Vulvar carcinoma (Choice E) most commonly presents with a vulvar lesion on the labia majora that often is pruritic or friable, leading to vulvar bleeding and pain. Risk factors include tobacco use, human papillomavirus infection, and an immunocompromised status. This patient has a large mass protruding from her vagina, rather than a plaque or ulcer on her labia majora, making vulvar carcinoma less likely."

D) Patent ductus arteriosus
E) Pulmonary artery dilation
",D,"Congenital rubella presents with the classic triad of cataracts, sensorineural deafness, and congenital heart disease. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and pulmonary artery stenosis are the most common cardiac defects. The ductus arteriosus (DA) is one of several physiologic shunts existing during the prenatal period. In utero, oxygenated blood is obtained from the placenta, not from the lungs, and the DA allows the shunting of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta while bypassing the fetal lungs, which are filled with amniotic fluid. At birth, closure of the DA occurs by the release of prostaglandins and increased arterial oxygen tension. With increased blood oxygenation and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance following birth or with indomethacin use, prostaglandin production falls and the ductus closes. PDA presents with a heart murmur described as a continuous ""machine-like"" murmur best heard in the left second intercostal and left infraclavicular regions. Since blood flow through the PDA occurs in both systole and diastole, the sound will be present throughout the cardiac cycle. Certain congenital heart diseases require the presence of a shunt to allow arteriovenous admixture of oxygenated blood, for example, transposition of the great vessels. In the absence of such a requirement for shunting, a PDA results in a chronic extracardiac left-to-right shunt that may result in pulmonary hypertension or right-sided heart failure, with the risk for Eisenmenger syndrome if uncorrected. PDAs that are small often go undetected until adulthood because the left-to-right shunt is not significant enough to cause symptoms.","Anomalous congenital coronary artery (Choice A) is a rare entity with a wide variety of anatomic patterns that can occur in isolation or in association with other congenital heart diseases, such as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, and truncus arteriosus. While congenital rubella can lead to coronary artery stenosis later in life, it is not associated with congenital anomalous development of these vessels.

Congenital hypertension (Choice B) causes include coarctation of the aorta, neonatal hyperthyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and congenital anomalies of the urinary tract. While rubella can cause pulmonary hypertension if a PDA is present and not corrected, it is not associated with congenital systemic hypertension.

Cyanotic heart disease (Choice C) describes congenital heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulation (eg, a right-to-left shunt). Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallot, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Left-to-right shunting (acyanotic heart disease) occurs with ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and PDA.

Pulmonary artery dilation (Choice E) can develop later on in children with congenital rubella if an uncorrected PDA leads to a left-to-right shunt and pulmonary hypertension. However, this would not be present in the neonatal period. Rubella is associated with congenital pulmonary artery stenosis, not dilation."

",C,"Abnormal uterine bleeding should be suspected when bleeding is irregular, unpredictable, or not associated with usual premenstrual signs and symptoms (eg, bloating, breast fullness, uterine cramps). It may be caused by malignancy, structural abnormalities (eg, cervical or endometrial polyps), adenomyosis, endometrial hyperplasia,inflammation or infection of the genital tract, coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, and endocrine dysfunction (eg, thyroid disorders, prolactin, androgens), and may be iatrogenic or idiopathic. In patients over agie 45 years who are perimenopausal or postmenopausal, there is a higher risk for endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy. Endometrial cancer commonly presents wi.th postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, as in this patient. Risk factors include prolonged, unopposed exposure to estrogen, such as early menarche, late menopause, chronic anovulatory cycles (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome), exogenous estrogen therapy, nulliparity, and obesity. The most appropriate next step in management is an endometrial biopsy to evaluate for the presence of endometrial cancer. If a patient cannot tolerate the procedure or if the procedure sampling is nondiagnostic, a dilatation and curettage or a hysteroscopy can be performed.","Combination oral contraceptive therapy (Choice A) is an effective method of contraception that may also be used to treat abnormal uterine bleeding secondary to anovulation, such as that seen in polycystic ovary syndrome. Oral contraceptives may also be of benefit in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. However, this patient is perimenopausal and has had prolonged uterine bleeding, which should prompt an evaluation for endometrial cancer.

Dilatation and curettage (Choice B) is useful in treating heavy or abnormal uterine bleeding that does not respond to less invasive measures. While it can be used in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer, it typically is reserved for patients who are unable to tolerate an endometrial biopsy or for those in which biopsy was nondiagnostic, as it is a more invasive surgical procedure requiring anesthesia.

Hysteroscopy (Choice D) is frequently used to evaluate the uterus for structural causes of irregular menstruation, as it can visualize the entire endometrial cavity. This makes it useful in the diagnosis of polyps and fibroids. Hysteroscopy can also be used to obtain an endometrial biopsy but is a more invasive option.

Progestin-only oral contraceptive therapy (Choice E) would not be the most appropriate next step in management of this case. While high concentrations of progesterone can decrease vaginal bleeding, it would be inappropriate to try to minimize this patient's bleeding without first establishing a diagnosis.

Reassurance and follow-up examination in 6 months (Choice F) is incorrect. This patient has had heavy vaginal bleeding for 3 months, which has likely significantly affected her life. Additionally, her symptoms are concerning for endometrial cancer, and she should undergo further evaluation to confirm or refute this diagnosis. Delaying diagnosis would increase the morbidity and mortality associated with a possible underlying malignancy."

D) Factor V Leiden mutation analysis

",D,"Factor V Leiden is an autosomal dominant condition wherein coagulation factor Vis resistant to inactivation by protein C, leading to a hypercoagulable state. Caused by a point mutation in the F5 gene of factor V, it is the most common inherited cause of hypercoagulability in white patients. Pregnancy causes a hypercoagulable state due to the overexpression of coagulation factors I, 11, VII, VIII, IX, and X, the underexpression of anticoagulant protein S, and venous stasis in the pelvis and lower extremities caused by hormonal changes and compression by the gravid uterus. Thromboembolic events during pregnancy or the postpartum period are therefore a common presentation of Factor V Leiden, as these patients are already predisposed to such events. Other presentations include thromboembolic events within the uteroplacental arteries, leading to placental infarction and possible intrauterine fetal demise, and cerebral vein thrombosis. A heritable coagulation disorder should be suspected in this patient with a history of provoked deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in combination with an extensive family history of thromboembolic events. Diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing or a functional assay evaluating activated protein C resistance. Venous thromboembolic event prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin) is indicated for gravid patients with Factor V Leiden and personal history of thrombosis/thromboembolism. Warfarin is a teratogen and should be avoided. Novel oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban and apixaban are not recommended because of fetal safety concerns.","Measurement of plasma fibrinogen concentration (Choice A) is often indicated in the evaluation of coagulopathy; it will be decreased in consumptive coagulopathies such as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and normal in common clotting factor deficiencies such as hemophilia A or B. Fibrinogen is among the clotting factors overexpressed in pregnancy, leading to a hypercoagulable state, but acquired hyperfibrinogenemia would not explain this patient's extensive family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Measurement of prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times (Choice B) is used to evaluate function of the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways, respectively, in patients with coagulopathy. Partial thromboplastin time may be decreased or normal in Factor V Leiden; genetic or functional testing are more sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of this disease.

Measurement of serum factor VIII (antihemophilic factor) antigen concentration (Choice C) may be performed for the diagnosis of hemophilia A, an X-linked coagulopathy caused by a deficiency in factor VIII synthesis. Factor VIII is also often decreased in von Willebrand disease, a hereditary bleeding disorder, as von Willebrand factor binds and stabilizes it in the plasma. This patient's history is suspicious for an inherited thrombophilia, not coagulopathy. Acquired increased factor VIII concentration is found in conditions including pregnancy, malignancy, and hyperthyroidism, but the association with VTE is weak.

Repeat venous Doppler ultrasonography (Choice E) would be indicated if this patient presented with features of DVT, such as unilateral lower extremity pain, erythema, and edema, along with tenderness on palpation and pain exacerbated with passive stretch of the foot. This patient is asymptomatic and requires genetic testing for suspected inherited thrombophilia in the setting of her significant family history and current pregnancy."

",B,"A 1-hour maternal glucose tolerance test is typically performed between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy to screen for gestational diabetes. However, this test can be done at the first prenatal visit if there is suspicion of underlying or preexisting diabetes or in patients who have a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 in addition to another risk factor, such as first-degree relatives with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, previous macrosomia or gestational diabetes, or a history of impaired glucose tolerance. Gestational or preexisting diabetes mellitus can lead to an increased risk for congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortion and stillbirth, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and birth trauma. Neonatal effects of diabetes can include hypoglycemia caused by a sudden change in the maternal-fetal glucose balance, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and an increased risk for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, the early recognition of both gestational diabetes and preexisting diabetes mellitus allows for the initiation of appropriate treatment, decreased average blood glucose concentrations, and improved neonatal outcomes.","Antibody screening (Choice A), along with ABO and Rh(D) typing, should be performed at the first prenatal visit for all patients. Rh(D)-negative mothers are at high risk for Rh(D) alloimmunization when exposed to Rh(D) antigens from the fetal circulation. Repeat antibody screening is not indicated for this Rh(D)-positive patient with uncomplicated pregnancy. Repeat testing for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis (Choice C) is not indicated for this asymptomatic patient with no high-risk sexual behavior. Repeat testing for previously negative patients may be considered if symptoms of cervicitis develop (eg, foul-smelling or discolored discharge, pruritus, dysuria) or for patients who have subsequently engaged in high-risk sexual behavior. Repeat urine culture (Choice D) following a negative prenatal urine culture can be considered for patients with symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) and in those at high risk for UTI, such as those with recurrent UTIs, urinary tract anomalies, or diabetes mellitus. It is not indicated for this asymptomatic patient with a negative routine urine culture screen. Repeat ultrasonography (Choice E) is not yet indicated for this patient in her second trimester with a normal 20-week ultrasound (routinely performed for anatomic survey and growth monitoring). Further, routine ultrasonography is not recommended until the patient reaches 28 weeks' gestation or later; these scans are used to monitor fetal growth and amniotic fluid index."

",F,"Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all sexually active patients under age 25 years. C. trachomatis is a sexually transmitted infection that classically presents with urethritis, dysuria, dyspareunia, and urethral or vaginal discharge. N. gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted infection that presents most commonly with mucopurulent discharge and pruritus. However, both infections can also be asymptomatic, thus the recommendation for screening. Complications include cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, tuba-ovarian abscess, and long-term issues with fertility. Diagnosis is made with a nucleic acid amplification test. Treatment consists of either azithromycin or doxycycline for chlamydia and ceftriaxone for gonorrhea.","Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody assays (Choice A) are useful in the diagnosis of active hepatitis B infection, which is a blood-borne infection. Acute hepatitis B presents with fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and jaundice. While hepatitis B surface antibodies are present in those vaccinated against hepatitis B and those infected with hepatitis B, hepatitis B surface antigen is only positive in those that have an acute or chronic infection. Asymptomatic screening for infection is not recommended for patients who are vaccinated, such as this patient.

Human papillomavirus nucleic acid testing (Choice B) is used to detect the presence of human papillomavirus infection, which is a sexually transmitted viral infection that can cause cervical/vulvar and penile/anal carcinoma, as well as condylomata acuminata. Screening for this virus is often not recommended until a patient is 30 years old, because many infections occurring in younger patients will be self-limited.

Pap smear (Choice C) refers to an evaluation of cells of the cervix as a screening modality for cervical cancer. It is recommended to start for patients at age 21 years and be repeated every 3 years. After age 30 years, it can be repeated every 5 years if it is done in conjunction with human papillomavirus co-testing and both results are normal. This patient is 15 years old, and thus Pap smear is not yet recommended.

Rapid plasma reagin (Choice D) is the serologic test for syphilis and is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Syphilis has a multitude of presentations depending on its stage. Primary syphilis can present with a genital lesion that is nonpainful, while secondary syphilis presents with a maculopapular rash and condyloma lata. Tertiary syphilis, the most advanced form, has symptoms of neurosyphilis (eg, tabes dorsalis, Argyll Robertson pupil, ataxia) and aortitis. This patient is not experiencing any of these symptoms.

Repeat hepatitis B vaccine series (Choice E) is not necessary. This patient is up-to-date on her vaccines, and unless she demonstrates nonimmunity to hepatitis B, repeat vaccination is not required."

",C,"Vaginal discharge following delivery is termed lochia and may last during the period of the puerperium for 4 to 6 weeks. It is caused by the shedding of the superficial decidua and progresses through three stages. The early discharge, lochia rubra, contains blood and may last for up to 10 days. Lochia slowly becomes less bloody and more serous, lochia serosa, for approximately 2 to 3 weeks before finally becoming white to yellow in color, lochia alba. Physical examination, laboratory studies, and diagnostic imaging are not typically performed but would be normal as lochia is a physiologic, rather than pathologic, condition.","Bacterial vaginitis (Choice A) is caused by vaginal overgrowth of Gardnerella vagina/is. It presents with gray, thin, malodorous vaginal discharge, a vaginal pH greater than 4.5, and a fish-like odor on KOH testing. Identification of clue cells on wet mount microscopy is a useful confirmatory test. This patient has thick, white vaginal discharge, making lochia alba more likely.

Candidiasis (Choice B) is caused by overgrowth of normal vaginal Candida flora, most commonly Candida albicans. It presents with vaginal pruritus, vulvar erythema, and a thick, white discharge with normal vaginal pH and negative KOH testing. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus and recent antibiotic or corticosteroid use. While this patient has white vaginal discharge, she has no other symptoms or risk factors to suggest candidiasis.

Retained products of conception (Choice D) can lead to secondary postpartum hemorrhage, which is bleeding that occurs 24 hours to 12 weeks after delivery. In addition to bleeding, retained products of conception can become infected, which presents with abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. This patient has no signs of bleeding or infection, making retained products of conception unlikely.

Undiagnosed vaginal laceration (Choice E) is not the cause of this patient's discharge. While most vaginal lacerations are diagnosed immediately following birth because of ongoing bleeding, an undiagnosed vaginal laceration may present with delayed vaginal bleeding. However, it would be unlikely to cause the white discharge this patient is experiencing."

The spleen is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin, and the liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory studies show:
Leukocyte count 5000/mm3
Segmented neutrophil 65%
Lymphocytes 30%
Platelet count 95,000/mm3
Serum quantitative immunoglobulin levels:
Hemoglobin lgA 420 mg/dL (N=14-159) lgG 2200 mg/dL (N=345-1236) lgM 400 mg/dL (N=43-207)
Which of the following mechanisms of disease is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A) Chediak-Higashi syndrome
B) Chronic granulomatous disease
C) Common variable immunodeficiency
D) Cystic fibrosis
E) HIV infection acquired via vertical transmission in the perinatal period
","(qid: 1169) A 2-year-old {dem-char-1} {dem-char-2} {dem-char-3} girl is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumococcal bacteremia. Over the past year, she has had three episodes of acute otitis media, two episodes of bacterial pneumonia, and recurrent episodes of thrush. Her mother has a history of persistent oral candidiasis and chronic diarrhea and has had a 9-kg (20-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. The patient is at the 50th percentile for height and 5th percentile for weight. The oral mucous membranes are covered with white plaques. Examination shows 2-cm, nontender, axillary lymph nodes.

E) HIV infection acquired via vertical transmission in the perinatal period
",E,"HIV infection acquired via vertical transmission in the perinatal period is the most likely diagnosis with a history of recurrent oral thrush, otitis media, and bacterial pneumonia, as well as cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly on examination. HIV transmission may occur at any time during gestation but is most acquired at or around the time of delivery and in the immediate postpartum period when the newborn is breast-feeding. Transmission is uncommon if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and has a low HIV viral load. As a result of universal screening for HIV in most developed countries, the incidence of perinatal and pediatric HIV has decreased, although this is not uniformly true in all countries around the world. Most patients present within the first few months of birth with recurrent pneumonia or opportunistic infections, though in some cases, symptoms and/or AIDS-defining conditions may not develop until many years later. Initial evaluation should include measurement of the HIV viral load with concomitant testing for mutations. While this patient should receive treatment for her bacterial pneumonia and thrush, she should also be started on antiretroviral therapy once HIV infection is confirmed.","Chediak-Higashi syndrome (Choice A) is caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene (LYST) essential for normal formation and transportation of lysosomes within the cell. It presents with frequent bacterial infections, oculocutaneous albinism, peripheral neuropathy, and progressive neurologic dysfunction.
Chronic granulomatous disease (Choice B) is caused by a deficiency in NADPH oxidase, an enzyme used to generate hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. These molecules are typically used to kill bacteria intracellularly. Patients present with recurrent pyogenic infections with catalase-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, with normal concentrations of leukocytes and immunoglobulins.
Common variable immunodeficiency (Choice C) classically presents in the second to fourth decades of life as multiple, recurrent sinus or pulmonary infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Testing will show low immunoglobulin concentrations.
Cystic fibrosis (Choice D) is associated with recurrent pulmonary infections as a result of the impaired clearance of mucous, microbes, and debris from the airways. Other findings include bronchiectasis, pancreatic insufficiency, diarrhea, malnutrition, and weight loss.
Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (Choice F) results from a variety of different mutations and commonly presents with recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections as a result of severe impairment in both B-and T-lymphocyte function in infancy.
Terminal complement deficiency (Choice G) typically presents with recurrent infections with Neisseria species.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (Choice H) is caused by a mutation in the WAS gene on the X-chromosome that encodes a protein essential for actin cytoskeleton rearrangement that occurs during interactions between T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and B lymphocytes, leading to an impaired innate and adaptive immune system. Patients present with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and infections with encapsulated bacteria and opportunistic pathogens."
