",E,"Endoscopic management has not been successful at achieving hemostasis, and the patient continues to have a high rate of hemorrhage given the hemoglobin concentration did not change with the transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells. The radiolabeled erythrocyte scan has localized the bleed to the right lower quadrant, but angiography has not revealed the exact site. Without a known site, angiographic interventions (such as arterial embolization) cannot be performed. Given the rate of hemorrhage, the next step is surgical management. Though the bleed is localized to the right lower quadrant, segmental colectomy is associated with high rates of rebleeding and mortality in the absence of an identified lesion. The next appropriate step in management is total abdominal colectomy.","Capsule endoscopy (Choice A) is more appropriate for stable, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. If the site of bleeding is not evident from endoscopic work-up, lesions in the middistal small bowel can be evaluated using capsule endoscopy.

Left hemicolectomy (Choice B) would be indicated if a lesion were identified in the left colon by colonoscopy or angiography, and interventions via those routes were unsuccessful. For this patient, the right hemicolon is implicated, but no specific site has been identified.

Repeat angiography (Choice C) could be considered if the patient was stable; however, this patient continues to have low hemoglobin concentration despite aggressive blood product resuscitation. Angiography is specific but not sensitive, as it can only detect active bleeding at rates greater than 0.5 ml/min. For this patient, definitive control of hemorrhage via surgery should not be delayed.

Repeat radiolabeled erythrocyte scan (Choice D) is unlikely to provide further useful information at this time. It is more sensitive than angiography, as it can detect active bleeding at rates between 0.1 to 0.5 ml/min. However, it can only localize bleeding to general segments of bowel. Follow-up to a positive radiolabeled erythrocyte scan is colonoscopy, angiography, or surgery to isolate a lesion and control bleeding."

C) Barium swallow
D) Ultrasonography of the abdomen
E) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
",C,"The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is performing a barium swallow. Progressive dysphagia requires a prompt diagnostic workup. Dysphagia is caused by structural/anatomic lesions and/or neuromuscular/motility problems. Most patients will undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) initially; however, patients with a history suggesting a lesion that is at risk for esophageal perforation should be evaluated with a barium swallow first. This includes patients with known or suspected laryngeal or esophageal cancer, history of caustic injury or radiotherapy to the esophagus, or clinical features suggestive of pharyngoesophageal (Zenker) diverticulum. Pharyngoesophageal (Zenker) diverticulum occurs within the hypopharynx between the cricopharyngeus muscle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. The mechanism of formation includes an uncoordinated swallowing mechanism, which results in muscle spasms of the cricopharyngeus leading to pulsion diverticula as the wall of the hypopharynx and superior esophagus weakens. Symptoms include halitosis, regurgitation of undigested food, and progressive dysphagia. Barium swallow shows a posterior, midline outpouching above or at the level of the cricopharyngeus. Treatment includes surgical repair and resection (diverticulectomy), as well as dietary modifications to include soft or liquid foods.","24-Hour esophageal pH monitoring (Choice A) can be used to confirm the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to monitor response to treatment. GERD typically presents with burning epigastric and lower chest pain that worsens with large meals, trigger foods, and supine positioning. Dysphagia as a symptom of GERD does occur; however, diagnostic evaluation for structural and motility abnormalities should be performed first. Esophageal manometry (Choice B) is used to evaluate for esophageal motility disorders. It is typically performed after an EGD and barium swallow if the etiology of dysphagia is still uncertain. Ultrasonography of the abdomen (Choice D) can be used to evaluate for bowel obstruction or ileus. It does not provide useful information in the workup of oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Choice E) is not recommended as the initial study in a patient with clinical features of pharyngoesophageal (Zenker) diverticulum, as blind endoscopy could result in life-threatening esophageal perforation."

",E,"The most appropriate next step in management is esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Mild epigastric pain and nausea after eating is commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, this patient also has occult blood in the stool. Evidence of a gastrointestinal bleed (melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, positive occult blood in stool, unexplained iron deficiency anemia) with these symptoms is an indication for EGD to rule out malignancy. Unexplained weight loss, anorexia, progressive dysphagia, and a first-degree relative with cancer are additional red flags. EGD can rule out additional diagnoses, such as esophagitis, and collect biopsy samples at the time of the procedure. Biopsy samples may look for Helicobacter pylori infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disorders.","Recommend avoidance of caffeine (Choice A), and other dietary changes, would be appropriate following a diagnosis of gastritis or GERD. However, the patient needs further workup to identify the etiology of his symptoms. Serum Helicobacter pylori antibody assay (Choice B) is not commonly used, as serology cannot distinguish between an active or past infection. Urea breath testing or stool antigen testing may be useful if the initial EGD and biopsy are nondiagnostic. Upper gastrointestinal series (Choice C) should be performed prior to an EGD for patients at risk of esophageal perforation. This includes patients with known or suspected laryngeal or esophageal cancer, history of caustic injury or radiotherapy to the esophagus, or clinical features suggestive of Zenker diverticulum. This patient does not have any concerning history, and EGD should be the initial diagnostic test. CT scan of the abdomen (Choice D) may be a useful follow-up study if the EGD is inconclusive. However, cross-sectional imaging studies are less sensitive for lesions along the luminal surface. EGD is preferred for the initial workup as biopsy acquisition and any indicated therapeutic measures can be performed at the time of the study."

E) Toxic megacolon
",E,"This patient's presentation is highly concerning for toxic megacolon, a rare but known complication of ulcerative colitis. Toxic megacolon is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by extensive inflammation of the colon. The classic constellation of clinical manifestations includes high fever, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, enlarged and dilated bowel, and impaired colonic motility. More generally, ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition within the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colonic mucosa, typically beginning with the rectum and advancing proximally. Symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, bloody diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and tenesmus. Extraintestinal manifestations such as uveitis also occur. In addition, because of the chronic inflammation of the colon, patients are at increased risk of developing colorectal carcinoma. Treatment of ulcerative colitis flares includes supportive care, immunomodulators, biologics, and steroids. In severe cases, a partial or total colectomy may be required, especially in cases of toxic megacolon.","Carcinoma of the colon with obstruction (Choice A) is another potential complication of chronic inflammatory bowel disease but is less likely to explain the patient's current presentation. Large bowel obstruction typically presents with abdominal pain, distension, obstipation, and constipation. X-rays typically show proximal colonic dilation with a transition point at the site of the obstruction. Dysplasia of the colon with hemorrhage (Choice B), also called angiodysplasia, is a common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding and could explain the patient's hematochezia. However, the patient's other symptoms are more suggestive of toxic megacolon. Enterocolonic fistula (Choice C) is uncommon in patients with ulcerative colitis. Fistula formation is more common in Crohn disease as the inflammatory process involves all layers of the bowel wall, while in ulcerative colitis inflammation is limited to the mucosa and submucosa. Gastroenteritis (Choice D) is common and presents with a variety of clinical manifestations, including fever, nausea, abdominal pain, distention, and diarrhea. However, in a patient with known inflammatory bowel disease and colonic distension on imaging, more aggressive management for toxic megacolon is needed."

",D,"Ischemic colitis refers to insufficient blood flow to an area of the intestine and should be suspected in a patient with abdominal pain and hematochezia. It can be caused by an occlusion of the mesenteric vasculature, such as from thromboembolism or dissection, or from hypotension or limited blood flow causing a watershed infarction. Aortic surgery is a known risk factor for ischemic colitis, often because of dislodgement of endovascular plaques with subsequent embolization, or because of hypotension. Risk factors for acute ischemic colitis include older age, coronary artery disease, hypercoagulability, peripheral arterial disease, or recent endovascular surgery. Typical symptoms of patients with acute ischemic colitis include crampy abdominal pain, tenderness over the affected bowel, and hematochezia. Ischemic colitis can be complicated by necrosis, viscus perforation, or ileus. Treatment typically involves supportive care, anticoagulation, antibiotics, and surgery in cases of bowel infarction, necrosis, or perforation.","Aortoenteric fistula (Choice A) is an abnormal communication between the aorta and gastrointestinal lumen commonly caused by compression or inflammation of the aorta or bowel in proximity to each other, often in the setting of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Patients may present with gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be mild or may lead to rapid exsanguination. This patient's history of recent surgery complicated by hypotension is more suggestive of ischemic colitis.

Cecal angiodysplasia (Choice B) refers to an abnormal dilation and ectasia of a cecal blood vessel. Cecal angiodysplasia is often acquired and presents in older adults with gastrointestinal bleeding. It would not be expected to cause acute gastrointestinal bleeding shortly following aortic surgery.

Diverticulosis (Choice C) is characterized by sac-like protrusions of the colonic wall and is the most common cause of painless hematochezia. Risk factors for the development of diverticulosis include abnormal colonic motility, high dietary intake of red meat and low dietary fiber, physical inactivity, and obesity. This patient's abdominal cramps and tenderness are not suggestive of diverticulosis.

Pseudomembranous colitis (Choice E) occurs in infection with Clostridium difficile, a bacterium that causes colitis in patients with recent exposure to antibiotics. Patients do not typically present with hematochezia."

",D,"Hemorrhoids occur because of enlargement and distal displacement of the anal cushions, which are normal prominences of the anal mucosa composed of smooth muscle, vascular, and connective tissues, and play an important role in maintaining continence. Hemorrhoids may primarily involve tissue derived from the internal, superior hemorrhoidal plexus or the external, inferior hemorrhoidal plexus. Symptoms include pain with defecation, incontinence, hematochezia, and anal itching. Hemorrhoids may also undergo acute thrombosis and cause acute, often severe pain. The diagnosis is clinical and may be established with a rectal examination, which can be facilitated via anoscopy. Treatment is mainly supportive and includes a high fiber diet, sitz baths, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Band ligation, sclerotherapy, or surgical excision may be used for severe hemorrhoids or those that fail to improve with conservative management.","Barium enema (Choice A) is useful for the diagnosis of colonic polyps, colorectal carcinoma, and diverticulosis, but is not the best step in the evaluation of hemorrhoids. Endorectal ultrasonography (Choice B) is useful for the evaluation of the prostate gland and to assess the depth of mucosal invasion of colorectal carcinoma. It plays no role in the evaluation of hemorrhoids. CT scan of the abdomen (Choice C) is useful for the evaluation of diverticulitis, among other colorectal pathologies, which presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, fever, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. Diverticulitis does not produce palpable, tender masses at the anal margin. Colonoscopy (Choice E) is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma. Colorectal carcinoma is among the most diagnosed cancers but is uncommon in younger patients and typically does not produce palpable, tender masses at the anal margin."

",A,"Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of a gallstone or gallstones in the gallbladder, and choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of a gallstone located within the biliary tree. Gallstones can result in varying degrees of obstruction, which dictates the severity of presenting symptoms. Cholelithiasis can result in colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain (biliary colic), nausea, or vomiting; with obstructive choledocholithiasis, increased direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase may be present on laboratory assay, along with persistent, non-colicky discomfort on examination. Hyperbilirubinemia can lead to scleral icterus and jaundice. Depending on the location of the bile duct stone, choledocholithiasis can result in acute pancreatitis, which manifests with epigastric pain and increased pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase). Acute cholangitis occurs secondary to acute bacterial infection of the biliary tree, typically in the setting of biliary instrumentation or choledocholithiasis as a precursor. Cholangitis describes a bacterial infection or inflammation of the biliary tree, and commonly presents with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice (Charcot triad), along with possible shock and altered mental status (Reynold pentad). Treatment includes fluid resuscitation, antibiotic therapy, and procedural intervention to clear any obstruction and permit drainage of infection.","Cholecystitis (Choice B) generally results from obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone with resultant bacterial infection of the gallbladder, and presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. Since it does not cause obstruction of the common bile duct, it would not typically present with jaundice.

Gastritis (Choice C) classically presents with left upper quadrant and epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Gastritis commonly occurs from alcohol abuse, excess use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, and smoking. It does not typically cause fever and would not result in jaundice.

Hepatitis (Choice D) from viral infections can present with right upper quadrant discomfort, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased transaminases, and abnormal serologic studies (eg, HBsAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc, Anti-HGV) showing titers indicative of the infection. However, this patient's 2 weeks of colicky pain after eating prior to the acute presentation is more indicative of a gallstone-related pathology.

Pancreatitis (Choice E) can also be caused by gallstones obstructing the ampulla of Vater, resulting in epigastric pain, and increased pancreatic enzymes. However, pancreatitis in absence of obstructive biliary ductal disease would not cause jaundice."

",A,"Upper endoscopy is a generally safe procedure, though complications can include bleeding, aspiration, and perforation; depending on the purpose of the endoscopy, specific complications such as pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can occur. In the case of dysphagia in this patient, the endoscopy was performed and dilated an esophageal stricture to promote passage of food bolus. Stretching of smooth muscle, stricture, and connective tissue, especially if chronic inflammation has resulted in compromise of the stromal strength of the esophageal wall, can lead to perforation. A perforated esophagus is diagnosed on water-soluble contrast esophagography. An esophageal perforation permits translocation of gastrointestinal contents such as food, stomach acid, and bacteria into the mediastinum, which can lead to fatal mediastinitis if untreated. Mediastinitis can present with chest pain and a generally toxic appearance (eg, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis). Management of esophageal perforation is through antibiotics and emergent surgical intervention.","CT scan of the chest (Choice B) can diagnose esophageal perforation if esophageal contrast studies are negative and clinical suspicion remains high. It can also identify intrathoracic fluid collections that may require drainage. However, water-soluble contrast esophagography is the best first step in diagnosis. Repeat upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Choice C) would not be appropriate, as it may exacerbate the mediastinitis due to air insuffiated during endoscopy. Thoracentesis (Choice D) or thoracostomy (Choice E) may be necessary if translocated gastric contents develop into an empyema; however, such a complication would not be evident for several days and may be avoided altogether with the use of antibiotics."

",D,"lncisional pain after an abdominal surgery can be moderate to severe and typically lasts for days to weeks. Oral administration of non-opiate medications may be helpful for pain control, but many patients may require opioid analgesics to control severe pain. Typically, the approach to adequately controlling pain is multimodal. While opioid medications can offer strong analgesia, opiates are central nervous system depressants and can lead to dependence, addiction, and death. Opiate intoxication causes sedation, bradycardia and hypotension, depressed respiratory drive, and constricted pupils. Opiates are commonly used for analgesia and act on receptors within the gastrointestinal tract, reducing gut motility and thus causing constipation. Adjunctive pain medications, such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, gabapentin, and others, can help reduce the use of opiate medications and reduce the risk for its side effects, tolerance, and dependence. Short-term therapy following surgery with opiate compounds is indicated, though care should be taken to avoid prolonged use due to the risk of side effects and dependence.","Oral aspirin (Choice A) is effective for mild to moderate pain relief but would not adequately address postoperative pain. It also can affect bleeding, clotting, and healing, so would not be the first choice for analgesia in a postoperative patient. Diazepam (Choice B) is a benzodiazepine that may be useful for managing agitation, anxiety, muscle spasms, or seizures. It does not have pain-relieving effects that would be appropriate for treating postoperative pain. Oral morphine sulfate (Choice C) and other opiate medications can be helpful in treating severe acute pain. However, multimodal pain regimens such as those containing acetaminophen and other non-opiate medications are safer and reduce the risk of opiate tolerance or dependence. Transcutaneous fentanyl (Choice E) is typically used for opiate-dependent patients for basal administration of pain medicine. This patient has acute pain after a recent surgery, and a fentanyl patch would be inappropriate. Infiltration of the wound with bupivacaine (Choice F) would be helpful for immediate pain, but only lasts for several hours and would not be adequate to help treat postoperative pain that can last for days."

",D,"In congenital biliary atresia, the common bile duct is occluded, diminutive, or absent, and bile is unable to pass into the duodenum. This precludes the use of bile in the digestion of dietary fats and causes fat malabsorption. In contrast to benign causes of neonatal jaundice, biliary atresia presents with progressively worsening jaundice (conjugatedhyperbilirubinemia), pale stools, dark urine, poor weight gain, and, in untreated cases, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension. Classically, benign etiologies of neonatal jaundice will improve by the second to third week of life, whereas biliary atresia will persist and often worsen within the first 8 weeks of life. Diagnosis consists of history and physical examination, liver function testing, HIDA scan or cholangiography, with definitive diagnosis occurring during exploratory surgery with visualization of atretic bile ducts. Treatment is through hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure), which restores biliary flow, reduces jaundice, and helps salvage the native liver function. Liver transplant may be required if the procedure is unsuccessful.","Decreased bilirubin conjugation by hepatocytes (Choice A) would cause indirect bilirubinemia, as opposed to the direct bilirubinemia seen in this case. Gilbert syndrome is a
hereditary cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by diminished activity of uridine glucuronosyltransferase. Patients generally present with mild jaundice during periods
of physiologic stress. In most cases, the condition is harmless.
Decreased bilirubin excretion by hepatocytes (Choice B) occurs in Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome, which are characterized by defective hepatocellular excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile canaliculi. This results in a direct hyperbilirubinemia.
Decreased bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes (Choice C) occurs to a mild extent in Gilbert syndrome, which is characterized by transient episodes of mild jaundice in response to fasting and stress.
Increased bilirubin production (Choice E) can occur with hemolytic anemias, which result in indirect hyperbilirubinemia caused by the release of heme into the bloodstream during red blood cell lysis."

",C,"Acute kidney injury is defined as an acute increase in creatinine by greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl or 1.5 times above baseline creatinine, occasionally with oliguria or anuria. Acute kidney injury can be prerenal (because of dehydration, low vascular perfusion states such as congestive heart failure, or intrinsic such as acute tubular necrosis) or postrenal because of obstruction. A common cause is acute tubular necrosis, which can be caused by ischemia in the setting of prolonged hypoperfusion or toxins. A way to distinguish between the causes of acute kidney injury is by measuring the fractional excretion of sodium. The fractional excretion of a solute measures the percentage of the original filtered amount that is present in the excreted urine. The calculations are made using the plasma and urine concentrations of the sodium and creatinine. Prerenal and intrinsic kidney injury can be distinguished by the fractional excretion of sodium, which is <1 % in prerenal and >2% in intrinsic kidney injury. In acute tubular necrosis, laboratory evaluation will show a blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio of less than 20, a fractional excretion of sodium greater than 2%, and muddy brown casts on urinalysis.","Administration of spironolactone (Choice A) would not likely explain this presentation. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that serves as an aldosterone receptor antagonist. It would not be appropriate to start a diuretic before diagnosing the cause of acute kidney injury, as it can exacerbate the kidney injury. Measurement of plasma free hemoglobin concentration (Choice B), the amount of hemoglobin that is not enclosed in red blood cells, may help diagnose hemolytic anemia and explain renal tubular injury from free hemoglobin. Measurement of free hemoglobin concentration would not be informative in delineating causes of acute kidney injury in the setting of blood transfusion unless hemolysis or incompatibility were expected. Renal ultrasonography (Choice D) is useful in evaluation of the patient's increased serum creatinine level and should be performed, but it is not likely to disclose the diagnosis on its own in a case of hypotension and blood loss preceding kidney injury. Replacement of the urinary catheter (Choice E) would be appropriate if the acute kidney injury is caused by urinary obstruction. However, this typically would present with abdominal and suprapubic distention, or evidence of a retroperitoneal process in the history or examination."

",C,"A patient with pelvic injury and blood at the urethral meatus raises suspicion for a urethral injury. Urethral injuries are characterized by difficulty voiding, blood at the urethral meatus, perineal ecchymosis, and may be associated with a pelvic fracture. Straddle injuries can cause trauma to the anterior urethra, while pelvic fractures may injure the posterior urethra. Urethral injuries are evaluated by retrograde urethrography, which involves the injection of contrast into the urethra to evaluate for the extravasation of contrast, indicating urethral discontinuity. Depending on the location and severity of urethral injury, patients may require surgical repair or the placement of a urethral catheter to help promote healing and prevent complications of urinary extravasation, infection, urethrocutaneous fistula, or urethral stricture.","Cystography (Choice A) is indicated for evaluation of the urinary bladder when a bladder injury is suspected. This allows for characterization of an intraperitoneal versus extraperitoneal bladder rupture, but it would not be the best first choice in suspected urethral injury. Intravenous pyelography (Choice B) involves the intravenous injection of radiopaque contrast to subsequently visualize the kidney collecting system, ureters, and bladder under fluoroscopy. This allows for the investigation of suspected urinary tract anatomic abnormalities, malignancies, obstruction, malformation, and strictures. Ultrasonography of the pelvis (Choice D) such as that performed in a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination would be able to identify free peritoneal fluid; similarly, a CT scan of the pelvis (Choice E) can identify solid organ injury and the presence of free fluid, but neither would be able to directly identify a urethral injury. Insertion of a urinary catheter (Choice F) would be contraindicated as the first step in management in a patient with blood at the urethral meatus, portending a likely urethral injury. It may cause further trauma and injury to the urethra and internal pelvic structures without the injury first being delineated on retrograde urethrography."

",C,"The most common cause of unilateral bloody nipple discharge is an intraductal papilloma, which may be associated with focal ductal carcinoma in situ. However, an intraductal papilloma itself is a benign lesion. Nipple discharge may be caused by lactation, physiologic mechanisms such as galactorrhea, or pathologic lesions such as breast cancer or infection. Evaluation includes a careful history and physical examination, with particular attention paid to whether the discharge is unilateral or bilateral, if it is from a single or multiple ducts, and whether it is associated with any breast abnormalities (eg, skin changes, breast lumps). Lactation and physiologic discharge are more commonly bilateral and from multiple ducts, whereas pathological lesions more commonly present unilaterally. Further diagnostic evaluation of pathologic discharge, as in this patient, often involves ultrasonography or mammography based on patient age. If an abnormality is detected, biopsy is recommended.","Ductal carcinoma in situ (Choice A) may present with unilateral bloody nipple discharge, as well as a breast mass, and it may be associated with an intraductal papilloma. However, this patient's mammography showed normal findings, making breast cancer such as ductal carcinoma in situ unlikely. Fibroadenoma (Choice B) is a well-circumscribed, mobile breast mass generally seen in women of reproductive age. Mammography or ultrasonography would show a solid mass. Fibroadenomas do not routinely present with nipple discharge. Paget disease of the breast (Choice D) describes skin changes of the nipple and areola that are often related to underlying malignancy. These skin changes include discoloration, erythema, and ulceration. While Paget disease of the breast can also present with bloody unilateral nipple discharge, this patient does not have the skin findings associated with Paget disease, nor does she have evidence of malignancy on mammography. Prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma (Choice E) can cause hyperprolactinemia, which can cause galactorrhea. Galactorrhea presents with bilateral, multiductal discharge of clear or milky fluid in patients that are not physiologically lactating. Other symptoms in premenopausal women include menstrual cycle irregularities and infertility, as well as headache or visual changes from the adenoma itself.

",E,"Breast masses are common in women. Evaluation of a new breast mass includes a thorough history and physical examination. Benign masses are commonly small, well-circumscribed, and mobile, whereas malignant lesions are more likely to be large, poorly defined, adherent to underlying tissue, and associated with skin or nipple changes. Further diagnostic evaluation of a breast mass depends on the patient's age, as well as the clinical concern for malignancy. In patients younger than 30 years old, ultrasonography is utilized as the initial imaging modality to further analyze a palpable breast mass. For older patients, mammography is the initial imaging technique of choice. Occasionally, abnormalities on one imaging modality are confirmed with the alternative imaging modality. In this case, the patient's mass visualized on mammography was confirmed with breast ultrasonography, which disclosed a cystic-appearing lesion. Cystic lesions should be carefully observed or undergo needle aspiration for cytologic evaluation or symptomatic benefit. A simple cyst that completely collapses after aspiration requires no further management.","Excisional biopsy (Choice A) involves surgical excision of the entire breast mass, whereas an incisional biopsy (Choice B) removes only a portion of the mass. These procedures may be utilized for solid lesions that have imaging findings or clinical symptoms concerning for malignancy. This patient has a cystic-appearing lesion more suitable for needle aspiration, a less invasive option than biopsy that may provide diagnostic as well as therapeutic benefit. Mammography-localized core needle biopsy (Choice C) may be useful in evaluating a solid lesion that is not evident on physical examination. Mammography localization allows the biopsy to include tissue more reliably from the area of imaging abnormality. This patient's lesion is cystic, palpable on physical examination, and easily evident on ultrasonography, making fine needle aspiration the more appropriate next step in management. MRI (Choice D) is rarely utilized in the evaluation of breast lesions. It is commonly used as a screening modality for patients at high risk for invasive breast carcinoma, such as those with the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes, given its high sensitivity in detecting breast cancer. It may also be used preoperatively to evaluate the extent of disease in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer or to evaluate for occult breast malignancy in patients with axillary lymphadenopathy. This patient's lesion is visible on both ultrasonography and mammography, making MRI unnecessary."

",D,"Breast masses are common in women, and breast cancer is the most common non-dermatologic malignancy in women. Evaluation of a new breast mass includes a thorough history and physical examination. Benign masses are commonly small, well-circumscribed, and mobile, whereas malignant lesions are more likely to be large, poorly defined, adherent to underlying tissue, and associated with skin or nipple changes. Further diagnostic evaluation of a breast mass depends on the patient's age, as well as the clinical concern for malignancy, and typically includes mammography and/or ultrasonography, in addition to biopsy when indicated. Although a significant portion of breast masses are benign, they may be associated with future malignancy. Lobular carcinoma in situ is a benign proliferative lesion with atypical cell characteristics that most commonly occurs in premenopausal women. However, it is associated with an increase in the risk of development of invasive breast carcinoma, which may occur in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast, although it is not considered a precursor lesion. Therefore, this patient is at greatest risk for developing invasive ductal carcinoma in the next 10 years. Other risk factors for the development of breast cancer include a family history of premenopausal breast cancer, genetic mutation (eg BRCA 1 or 2), early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, obesity, exogenous estrogen use, and African American ethnicity.","Bone metastasis (Choice A) is often associated with breast, prostate, and lung cancer. Typical presentations include bone pain, hypercalcemia (eg, abdominal pain, altered mental status, nephrolithiasis), and pathologic fractures. Given this patient's history of lobular carcinoma in situ, she is most at risk for the development of invasive breast cancer in the future, which may or may not be associated with metastasis.
Fibrocystic breast condition (Choice B) is a benign disease of the breasts characterized by multiple cystic masses that are often hormonally responsive and fluctuate in size. It may present with a palpable, painful breast mass that appears fluid-filled on imaging. Lobular carcinoma in situ is associated with the future development of invasive ductal carcinoma, not fibrocystic breast disease.
Intraductal papilloma (Choice C) is a benign growth of the lining of the breast duct. It most commonly presents with unilateral bloody nipple discharge. It is not associated with lobular carcinoma in situ.
Ovarian metastasis (Choice E) is often secondary to gastrointestinal cancer, such as colorectal cancer, or breast cancer, although the relative incidence of ovarian metastasis is low. They may be asymptomatic or present with abdominal pain and distention, with an adnexal mass on exam. Lobular carcinoma in situ is a benign lesion and would not cause ovarian metastasis."

",E,"Blunt trauma of the external genitalia in a male can lead to injury to the testes, penis, and anterior urethra. Specifically, blunt trauma to the penis can result in penile fracture, whereas trauma to the scrotum can cause rupture of the testes, vascular injury, and testicular torsion and hematoma. A straddle injury, as in this patient, causes injury to the perineum with subsequent disruption of the bulbar urethra. Penile fractures result with pain, edema, and ecchymoses, whereas testicular rupture or vascular injury presents with testicular swelling and ecchymoses, with disruption of the testicular anatomy. Disruption of the bulbar urethra presents with hematuria on urinalysis. This patient has many genitourinary abnormalities following his straddle injury, including a possible penile fracture, scrotal hematoma, and possible testicular vascular injury and urethral injury. The absence of blood flow to the testes is a surgical emergency and requires prompt evaluation by surgical exploration to try to restore blood flow and prevent testicular necrosis and resultant infertility. The next most appropriate step in management of this patient is surgical exploration.","Renal ultrasonography (Choice A) may be used to evaluate the kidney if there was suspicion of upper genitourinary tract injury. This more commonly occurs following blunt or penetrating trauma to the abdomen or retroperitoneum or on rapid deceleration injuries. It is less common with a straddle injury and would be likely to present with hematuria, flank pain, and hemodynamic instability.

MRI of the pelvis (Choice B) may be useful to evaluate for other occult injuries following this patient's fall. However, given the absence of blood flow to his testes, the time required for an MRI of the pelvis would likely lead to permanent damage to or possible necrosis of the testes.

Intravenous pyelography (Choice C) may be used to evaluate the integrity of the genitourinary system. It is obtained by injecting intravenous contrast and then obtaining an abdominopelvic x-ray. It is rarely used in emergency medicine and traumatic injury evaluation, as the availability of CT scan has minimized its utility. This patient has absence of blood flow to his testes, necessitating emergent surgical exploration which should not be delayed by further imaging.

Cystoscopy (Choice D) can be used to evaluate the urethra, bladder, and ureters. However, it is relatively contraindicated in patients with evidence of a urethral injury as it can lead to further disruption of the injury. Thus, it would be an inappropriate next step in the management of this patient."

Additionally, the patient has symptoms consistent with thyrotoxicosis, including irritability, weight loss, and diarrhea. A toxic adenoma presents as a solitary thyroid nodule accompanied by symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as heat intolerance, sweating, hair loss, warm, flushed skin, amenorrhea, diarrhea, palpitations, and weight loss. Vital signs may show hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension. The adenoma autonomously produces triiodothyronine (T J and thyroxine (T 4), unregulated by the normal negative feedback mechanism. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) will be low, as it remains governed by the levels of serum T 3 and T 4. Definitive diagnosis requires evaluation with ultrasonography to identify the thyroid nodule and a radioactive iodine uptake scan, which will demonstrate a solitary hyperfunctioning ('hot') nodule. Treatment generally requires partial thyroidectomy.","Defect in thyroxine (T 4) biosynthesis (Choice A) is incorrect, as this would lead to decreased levels of thyroxine, not increased levels. Graves disease (Choice B) is unlikely in this case. Patients with Graves disease have symptoms of thyrotoxicosis but usually demonstrate a diffusely enlarged thyroid on examination, rather than a solitary nodule. Multinodular goiter (Choice C) typically does not cause thyrotoxicosis, and the physical examination would disclose numerous thyroid nodules, not a single nodule. Riedel thyroiditis (Choice D) is incorrect, as patients with this condition are most often euthyroid or hypothyroid. Physical examination usually discloses a diffusely enlarged, firm thyroid. Thyroid carcinoma (Choice E) refers to one of several different types of thyroid cancer, including papillary and medullary thyroid carcinoma, among others. Thyroid malignancies typically do not secrete thyroxine. Thyroid cyst (Choice F) describes a type of thyroid lesion that can occasionally be palpated or visualized on thyroid ultrasonography. Cysts are nonfunctioning and do not secrete thyroxine, thus they do not cause hyperthyroidism. Thyroiditis (Choice G) refers to inflammation of the thyroid gland that can occur because of several conditions, including subacute thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, and medicationinduced thyroiditis. Patients may become transiently hyperthyroid, but these symptoms rarely last longer than 2 months before patients return to a euthyroid or hypothyroid state. This patient has demonstrated symptoms for 6 months. Triiodothyronine (T J thyrotoxicosis (Choice I) is common in patients with Graves disease and results from the increased secretion of T3 in addition to increased peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3. As well, this may occur in patients taking T 3 supplements."

E) Oral vitamin D3
",A,"Intravenous calcium gluconate should be given to this patient with signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia following thyroidectomy. The parathyroid glands are located along the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland and, while not frequent, can sometimes be inadvertently removed during a thyroidectomy. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which has numerous actions, including the stimulation of vitamin D activation in the kidneys and resorption of calcium from the bones to maintain calcium homeostasis. Loss of appropriate PTH production leads to hypocalcemia, with resultant symptoms that include perioral paresthesia, carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, and prolonged QT interval. The Chvostek sign, in which tapping of the facial nerve leads to spasm of the facial muscles, and Trousseau sign, in which an inflated blood pressure cuff occluding the brachial artery causes carpopedal spasm, are two physical examination findings that may indicate hypocalcemia. Treatment is with intravenous calcium gluconate. For these reasons, calcium and PTH are often monitored immediately following total thyroidectomy to aid in the early detection and treatment of hypocalcemia.","Intravenous magnesium sulfate (Choice B) is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic hypomagnesemia or QT prolongation with risk of dysrhythmia. Signs and symptoms of hypomagnesemia may include tremor, weakness, delirium, and arrhythmias. Hypocalcemia is frequently encountered in conjunction with hypomagnesemia, but this patient's recent surgery and current symptoms are more suggestive of hypocalcemia.

Oral calcium carbonate (Choice C) can be used for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism with mild hypocalcemia, but this patient has symptoms of severe hypocalcemia that warrant treatment with intravenous calcium.

Oral magnesium oxide (Choice D) is sometimes used as an antacid or as treatment for chronic hypomagnesemia. Treatment with magnesium oxide would not be beneficial to this patient with symptoms of hypocalcemia.

Oral vitamin D3 (Choice E) is a dietary supplement used to treat patients with mild vitamin D deficiency. Patients with mild vitamin D deficiency usually have normal calcium levels, although profoundly low vitamin D levels can occasionally lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. This patient's history suggests hypoparathyroidism secondary to surgical resection and vitamin D supplementation would be of little value at this time."

E) Norepinephrine
",A,"Antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin, ADH) is a hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary that leads to water reabsorption in the collecting duct of the renal tubule by increasing the amount of aquaporin channels. It also increases systemic vascular resistance by causing peripheral vasoconstriction and consequently increases blood pressure. Its secretion is stimulated by increased plasma osmolality and decreased arterial blood volume. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH) occurs when ADH is secreted independently of plasma osmolality or arterial blood volume. This most commonly occurs in neurologic injury, as a medication side effect, or because of ectopic production by a malignant tumor or lung disease. However, surgery can also cause an increase in secretion of ADH, thought to be secondary to pain. Inappropriate secretion of ADH in relation to plasma osmolality and blood volume results in decreased urine output; when this occurs, the residual urine is concentrated, with urine studies showing a urine osmolality above 100 mOsmol/kg and urine sodium above 40 mEq/L. While hypovolemia or obstruction can cause oliguria, these would likely also increase the patient's serum urea nitrogen and creatinine. As these parameters are normal, this patient's oliguria is most likely secondary to an increased concentration of ADH.","Cortisol (Choice B) is increased in Cushing syndrome, which presents with hypertension, central adiposity, moon facies, hirsutism, striae, proximal muscle weakness, and insulin resistance. This can be caused by Cushing disease, exogenous glucocorticoids, or a variety of other etiologies. However, Cushing syndrome more commonly presents with polyuria than oliguria.

Epinephrine (Choice C) and norepinephrine (Choice E) excess would be expected to present with signs of sympathetic nervous system activation, such as tachycardia and hypertension. This consequently would lead to increased cardiac output and theoretically increased renal perfusion, which may be associated with increased rather than decreased urine output.

Glucagon (Choice D) is secreted by the pancreas in response to hypoglycemia. It results in glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and decreased fatty acid synthesis. While there are receptors for glucagon within the renal tubules, it is generally not considered to contribute significantly to urine volume."

",E,"Hyponatremia, or serum sodium values less than 135 mEq/L, can be acute or chronic and is caused by a variety of etiologies. Acute hyponatremia is generally considered hyponatremia that develops in less than 48 hours and is more commonly symptomatic, whereas chronic hyponatremia has been present for more than 48 hours and may be asymptomatic. Mild hyponatremia can present with confusion, nausea, and fatigue, whereas severe hyponatremia can cause obtundation, seizures, and respiratory arrest. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is one common etiology of hyponatremia, caused by an increase in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) independent of plasma osmolality or arterial blood volume, often secondary to a neurologic insult as seen in this patient. ADH increases free water absorption in the collecting duct of the renal tubule, with subsequent free water intake and decreased urine output leading to hyponatremia. Acute, severe hyponatremia (especially when complicated by seizure activity) is lifethreatening and should be treated with hypertonic saline (3% sodium chloride) to symptom resolution, with gradual correction to normal once the acute emergency has resolved. Chronic hyponatremia should be slowly corrected to prevent central pontine myelinolysis.","Desmopressin (Choice A) is a synthetic analog of antidiuretic hormone or vasopressin. It increases water reabsorption in the collecting duct of the renal tubules and can thus worsen hyponatremia. Administering desmopressin would be an inappropriate next step in management of this patient. Glucose (Choice B) is used to treat hypoglycemia, which can present with altered mental status, nausea, diaphoresis, and tremors or seizures. It also presents with tachycardia and tachypnea caused by sympathetic activation, which are not present in this patient. Administration of glucose additionally would not improve this patient's hyponatremia. Naloxone (Choice C) is an opioid antagonist that is used to treat opioid overdose. Opioid overdose often presents with somnolence, bradypnea, and respiratory arrest in severe cases. Opioid overdose does not present with seizures, and therefore, naloxone would not be the appropriate treatment for this patient. Pentobarbital (Choice D) is a barbiturate medication that may be used to treat seizures. However, this patient's seizures are secondary to her acute, severe hyponatremia and the underlying cause of the seizures should be treated. This would best be accomplished with 3% sodium chloride."

",D,"Postoperative kidney injury is a risk of surgery, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal disease. This risk is further increased by surgeries that are associated with significant fluid shifts, such as intra-abdominal surgeries and cardiac surgeries, prolonged hypotension, and in elderly patients. This patient is demonstrating symptomatic hyperkalemia with peaked T-waves on ECG and increased creatinine and urea nitrogen, indicative of postoperative renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of intraoperative hypotension. Hyperkalemia can be a deadly consequence of renal failure, as it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and arrest. The first step in management of hyperkalemia includes administration of intravenous calcium to prevent cardiac cell excitability. Subsequent management includes medications that cause the transfer of potassium out of the serum and into the cells (eg, insulin, albuterol, sodium bicarbonate) along with agents that move potassium out of the body through the urine (eg, loop diuretics) and stool (eg, exchange resins). Hemodialysis may be required in emergent and severe cases.","Repeat measurement of serum potassium concentration (Choice A) may be appropriate in some cases of hyperkalemia, such as that due to hemolysis of the specimen. However, this patient has symptomatic hyperkalemia with peaked T-waves on ECG. Thus, he should be treated urgently with calcium chloride to prevent cardiac dysrhythmias.

Low-potassium diet (Choice B) may be appropriate for patients with chronic hyperkalemia in the setting of chronic renal disease. However, a low-potassium diet would require a significant period to reliably reduce this patient's potassium to normal levels, during which time he may have complications of hyperkalemia, such as cardiac dysrhythmias.

Rectal sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) therapy (Choice C) would not be an inappropriate choice in the management of this patient, as it takes hours to days to be effective and the patient would remain at risk for the complications of hyperkalemia during that time. Additionally, Kayexalate is associated with ischemic colitis and is being replaced by safer agents (eg, sodium zirconium sulfate) in practice.

Immediate hemodialysis (Choice E) is an appropriate treatment for severe metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia, certain intoxications, fluid overload, and uremia. However, prior to its initiation, less invasive measures should be attempted and may sufficiently avoid the need for dialysis. Additionally, the initiation of dialysis requires placement of a hemodialysis line and consultation with a nephrologist, time during which the patient may develop cardiac dysrhythmias."

",C,"Sudden postoperative hypotension is presumed to be caused by bleeding until determined otherwise. Other causes of postoperative hypotension include under-resuscitation during the procedure, medication side effects, and sepsis. Hypovolemia, whether due to anemia or fluid depletion, results in a compensatory tachycardia to try to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). However, with significant enough hypovolemia, the tachycardia is unable to maintain the MAP, the blood pressure subsequently falls, and the patient becomes hypotensive. Other evidence of postoperative bleeding in this patient includes a decrease in hematocrit from 42% to 28% (although a decrease in hematocrit may not always be present with an acute bleed), and a low central venous pressure indicating hypovolemia. Other signs of bleeding include pallor and swelling or ecchymoses of the surgical site. Management of postoperative hypotension caused by bleeding includes fluid resuscitation, blood product transfusion, presser therapy, and prompt surgical re-exploration.","Addisonian crisis (Choice A) occurs in adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency (depending on level -primary, secondary, tertiary) presents variably with weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation, hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Patients with Addison disease may develop an Addisonian crisis in response to a variety of stressors, such as severe infection or a surgical procedure. This often presents with lethargy, confusion, and hypotension. This patient has no other symptoms of Addison disease but does have a decreased central venous pressure and hematocrit, making postoperative bleeding a more likely cause of this patient's hypotension.

Myocardial infarction (Choice B) classically presents with crushing substernal chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and jaw, associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea. If the myocardial ischemia and infarction areas includes a significant portion of the myocardium, a decrease in cardiac output can occur with consequent hypotension. However, a myocardial infarction would be associated with a significantly higher concentration of CK-MB, which is an isoenzyme specific for myocardial damage.

Pulmonary embolus (Choice D) presents with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. If massive, it can lead to hypotension and cardiac arrest. When it occurs in post-surgical patients, it more commonly occurs several days after the procedure, often secondary to prolonged immobilization.

Septic shock (Choice E) generally presents with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, altered mental status, and signs of end-organ damage, such as an acute kidney injury or transaminitis, in a patient with a known or suspected infection. While it can occur immediately after surgery when the surgery involves infected tissues, it more often occurs several days following a procedure. The decrease in hematocrit in this case is more closely associated with hemorrhagic shock."

",C,"An informed, competent adult has the right to refuse blood transfusion, even if the blood may be lifesaving. One of the most common reasons for declining blood transfusion is identification as a Jehovah's witness. Many Jehovah's witnesses will not accept transfusions of whole blood, red blood cells, platelets, or plasma, although many will accept albumin. Additionally, they often decline autologous blood transfusions, although they often accept cardiopulmonary bypass. This patient is most likely experiencing traumatic hemorrhagic shock, based on his tachycardia, hypotension, positive focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam, and hematocrit, and appropriate resuscitation should occur with fluid and blood products to restore hemodynamic stability while he undergoes emergent surgical exploration. This patient is unable to consent, as he is only alert and oriented to self, and has no records that identify him as being a Jehovah's witness. While his friend believes he may be a Jehovah's witness, she is unsure, and there is no way to confirm this as his family is unable to be reached. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management of this patient is transfusion of packed red blood cells, as a delay in providing blood products in this hemodynamically unstable patient would likely lead to significant morbidity and mortality.","Immediate consultation with the hospital ethics committee (Choice A) would not be warranted in this patient. A delay in providing care to this patient to consult the ethics committee would lead to worsening of this patient's shock and a significant increase in his mortality. As this patient's status as a Jehovah's witness cannot be confirmed, he should receive a blood transfusion.

Intravenous administration of fluids only (Choice B) may be initially warranted in hypovolemic shock. However, with significant enough blood loss, hemoglobin and hematocrit decrease, and the patient will continue to be hypotensive despite fluid administration. This patient has hypotension with a hematocrit of 15% and ongoing blood loss, which warrants red blood cell transfusion.

Withholding treatment until the patient's Jehovah's Witness status can be confirmed (Choice D) is inappropriate. A delay in providing care to this patient would lead to worsening of this patient's shock and a significant increase in his mortality."

",B,"Scenarios frequently arise in healthcare in which patients are unable to consent for themselves. For example, patients with altered mental status or who are intubated and sedated lack the capacity to make decisions, which may be caused by the inability to understand the consent process or the inability to vocalize their desires. In this situation, the healthcare provider must receive consent from the patient's health care proxy. While different states have varying laws about the hierarchy of decision-makers, spouses, parents, and siblings are often included. This patient has had ongoing mechanical ventilatory requirements, and she is unlikely to wean from the mechanical ventilator soon given her recurrent hypoxia and hypercarbia. Prolonged orotracheal intubation can lead to laryngeal edema, tracheal stenosis, and oropharyngeal ulcers, whereas the placement of a tracheostomy improves patient comfort, allows them to communicate, and facilitates the ventilator weaning process. Thus, it would be in this patient's best interest to undergo tracheostomy placement. As her wishes are unknown, the most appropriate next step in management would be to reach out to her next of kin, in this case her sister, to obtain consent for the procedure.","Continuing current ventilator support with orotracheal intubation (Choice A) may be appropriate until her next of kin can be contacted. However, ongoing orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation can lead to patient discomfort, laryngeal edema, tracheal stenosis, and oropharyngeal ulcers. Transitioning this patient to ventilation through a tracheostomy tube would be in her best interest.

Contact the hospital ethics committee to give consent (Choice C) is not necessary, as this patient still has next of kin that could be contacted to make decisions for her. If the patient's sister cannot be contacted, then procedures that are deemed in the best interest of the patient can often proceed without consent. Alternatively, a court-appointed legal guardian can be assigned to assist with medical decision-making.

Discontinue sedation and determine if the patient can communicate her wishes (Choice D) is inappropriate. Attempts to wean this patient's sedation in the past have caused lifethreatening hypoxia and hypercarbia. This would likely occur with additional attempts to wean her sedation, so attempting to determine the patient's wishes would put her at an unacceptable level of risk.

Proceed with tracheostomy as a medical necessity (Choice E) is inappropriate. The patient still has next of kin that could consent to the procedure or that would have a better idea of this patient's goals of care. If the sister cannot be contacted, procedures that are deemed medically necessary and time-sensitive can often proceed without consent. Alternatively, a court-appointed legal guardian can be assigned to assist with medical decision-making."
