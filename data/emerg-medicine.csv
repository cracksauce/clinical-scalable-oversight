",D,"Near-drowning in children can result in a variety of clinical presentations depending on the severity of the drowning incident. Patients can present with aspiration, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and laryngospasm. Hypoxemia can lead to ischemic neuronal damage resulting in cerebral edema. In the case of drowning, aspirated fluid causes local inflammation in the lung, along with the dilution of surfactant, leading to impaired compliance and airspace infiltration. This can result in persistent and severe hypoxia despite management with positive end-expiratory pressure and increased fraction of inspired oxygen. Asymptomatic patients should be observed in the emergency department and admitted to the hospital if any clinical deterioration occurs. Symptomatic patients or patients who have continued hypoxia should be admitted to the hospital and be monitored until symptoms and hypoxia resolve. Point of-time evaluation is generally insufficient in these cases, as near-drowning can result in progressively worsening inflammation and hypoxia over hours to days, such that an initially normal evaluation may be falsely reassuring.","Discharge home and follow up in 1 week (Choice A) is inappropriate in this patient who has continued mild hypoxia on room air. The patient should be admitted for observation, as aspirated fluid can cause delayed inflammation and the patient is at risk for potential clinical deterioration and respiratory distress. Intravenous administration of antibiotics (Choice B) or corticosteroids (Choice C) would not be appropriate. There is no strong evidence to support the use of prophylactic antibiotics or routine steroids in near-drowning victims. Antibiotics should only be used in patients who later develop a pulmonary infection. Rapid sequence intubation (Choice E) would be appropriate in patients with severe respiratory distress, hypoxic and/or hypercarbic respiratory failure, or neurologic deterioration. This patient is not in respiratory distress and intubation is not currently indicated."

",B,"This patient is presenting with fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness in the right lower quadrant, raising suspicion for appendicitis. Appendicitis typically presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain that is often periumbilical at onset, along with nausea, anorexia, fever, leukocytosis, and tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant on examination. This patient also has signs of complicated or ruptured appendicitis presenting with peritoneal signs such as rebound tenderness and guarding on examination. Patients with appendicitis and other intra-abdominal infections typically have acute, severe pain that should be treated appropriately. Morphine is an opioid analgesic used to manage moderate to severe pain. It acts on ¬µ-opioid receptors to provide pain relief and is available in oral, intravenous, intramuscular, and suppository formulations. It is a potent analgesic that would be effective in treating this patient's pain.","Intravenous ketorolac (Choice A) can be used to treat moderate pain, but this patient likely has severe pain from a complicated appendicitis with peritoneal signs on examination. It would likely be inadequate in treating this patient's pain. Additionally, this patient will require surgery, and ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, presents an adverse effect of bleeding because of its effect on prostaglandin pathways. Oral acetaminophen (Choice C) and oral oxycodone (Choice D) should not be given to this patient awaiting a surgical consultation. Oral medications should be avoided in patients who may require emergent surgery, such as in this patient, because of the risk for aspiration while under anesthesia. Withholding medication prior to surgical evaluation (Choice E) is not recommended, as pain should always be adequately treated. As well, pain control with opioid analgesics has not been shown to obscure abdominal examination findings concerning for appendicitis or other surgical emergencies. This is in contrast to classic teaching, which formerly suggested that pain medication administration can confound the abdominal examination."

",D,"Synovial fluid crystal analysis is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis. This patient with right knee pain, swelling, and erythema most likely has gout and is experiencing an acute flare. Gout is an inflammatory joint disease that is caused by the precipitation of uric acid crystals in the joint space, which are highly inflammatory and lead to swelling, erythema, and pain. The most commonly affected joints are the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, but knees, elbows, wrists, and other joints can be involved. The diagnosis is made definitively by analysis of the joint aspirate, which will demonstrate needle-shaped crystals that are negatively birefringent under polarized light. Aside from synovial fluid crystal analysis, it is also important to perform a cell count and culture on the joint aspirate to rule out infection as septic arthritis and acute gout attacks can exist simultaneously in the same patient and in the same joint. Treatment for acute gout attacks includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or steroids. Long term urate lowering therapy is indicated in patients with kidney disease, tophaceous gout, and those with frequent gout attacks.","Serum C-reactive protein concentration (Choice A) is an inflammatory marker that, while potentially increased in acute gout attacks, is nonspecific. It would not be helpful in making a diagnosis in this case. Serum d-dimer assay (Choice B) is incorrect. The d-dimer is a useful tool for patients who are thought to have a low to intermediate probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep venous thrombosis (DVT). When negative, it effectively rules out a thrombus. This patient does not have signs or symptoms concerning for a PE or DVT. Serum uric acid concentration (Choice C) may be deceivingly low during acute gout flares and is not used to make a diagnosis of gout. While many patients with gout have an increased uric acid concentration, there are also many patients with increased uric acid concentrations that do not have gout. Synovial fluid lactic acid concentration (Choice E) is not useful in the diagnosis of gout. Lactate may be high in states of infection but is not routinely used for diagnosis."

",C,"Pregnancy is suspected when there is a missed or delayed menstrual period. Ectopic pregnancy is a nonviable, abnormal pregnancy in which the fertilized ovum implants in the fallopian tube (most common), on the ovary, within the peritoneal cavity, or in any nonendometrial location. An ectopic pregnancy often presents with vaginal bleeding and abdominopelvic pain early in pregnancy caused by the restricted area for fetal development. Physical examination may demonstrate adnexal tenderness on the side of implantation, as well as tenderness to palpation of the lower abdomen. Ectopic pregnancy can be complicated by rupture, bleeding, and hemoperitoneum, which can present with signs of hemodynamic instability, such as tachycardia and hypotension, as in this patient. Ultrasonography can be used to evaluate for an intrauterine pregnancy and may potentially visualize the location of an ectopic pregnancy, making it the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Ectopic pregnancy can be managed medically, using methotrexate for small, early pregnancies, but may require salpingectomy or evacuation with laparoscopy for larger pregnancies, in cases of medical treatment failure, or in any case of complication such as rupture.","CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Choice A) may disclose the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. However, it exposes the patient and her fetus (if it is a viable intrauterine pregnancy) to unnecessary radiation. Ultrasonography should first be utilized to evaluate this patient. Measurement of the serum ~-hCG concentration (Choice B) is used in the evaluation of a potential ectopic pregnancy in hemodynamically stable patients with a pregnancy of unknown location. ~-hCG concentration should double approximately every 48 hours in a normal intrauterine pregnancy but does not increase as expected in an ectopic pregnancy. This patient is hemodynamically unstable and should be evaluated with ultrasonography first to determine whether emergent surgical intervention is warranted. Urinalysis (Choice D) can be used to diagnose urinary tract infections, suchjson as cystitis or pyelonephritis. These present with dysuria, frequency, and urgency, as well as fever and flank pain in pyelonephritis. These would not explain this patient's hemodynamic instability in the setting of her positive pregnancy test and vaginal bleeding. X-ray of the abdomen (Choice E) is used in the evaluation of small bowel obstruction, and occasionally, nephrolithiasis. It would not be useful in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy."

",A,"Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction lasting less than 24 hours caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without evidence of infarction. This patient has developed focal neurologic deficits that resolved after 30 minutes, qualifying as a TIA. TIA can be induced by either an embolus arising from a proximal site or from temporarily decreased blood flow to a watershed area in the brain. A ""low-flow"" TIA typically lasts minutes while an embolic TIA lasts longer, as in this case. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow within a cerebral artery. Emboli most commonly originate from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. If the embolus successfully undergoes physiologic thrombolysis, blood flow is restored to the affected area and reverses the clinical symptoms. After a TIA, measures for the prevention of an ischemic stroke should be enacted. In this case, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to administer for secondary prophylaxis of a cerebral infarction is aspirin. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also stroke risk factors which should be optimized, though in this case the patient is already receiving treatment for these comorbidities.","Clopidogrel (Choice B) or dipyridamole (Choice C) may be used as combination therapy with aspirin in patients with a TIA or stroke who are already taking aspirin. However, as this patient's only previous medications are lisinopril and pravastatin, aspirin is the first-line choice for secondary prophylaxis of a cerebral infarction. Tissue plasminogen activator (Choice D) is used for its thrombolytic properties to treat ischemic stroke provided that it can be initiated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Because this patient's symptoms have resolved, she does not require tissue plasminogen activator. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin (Choice E) may be indicated in a patient with atrial fibrillation who develops a TIA. However, in this patient whose only comorbidities are hyperlipidemia and hypertension, warfarin is not indicated and carries an unnecessary increased risk for bleeding."

",B,"Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae can cause vaginitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PIO) in women. Risk factors for PIO and other sexually transmitted infections include adolescence, multiple sexual partners, and not using barrier contraception such as condoms. Vaginitis typically presents with mucopurulent discharge and pruritus. Cervicitis presents with similar discharge, but also with an erythematous, friable cervix and cervical motion tenderness on examination. When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and ovaries, pelvic inflammatory disease with purulent cervical discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and systemic symptoms such as fever can result. If left untreated, PIO can become complicated by a tube-ovarian or intraabdominal abscess, presenting with focal tenderness and a fluctuant mass. Treatment of PIO involves intravenous antibiotics such as cephalosporins and tetracyclines to cover potential infectious organisms, making ceftriaxone and doxycycline the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.","Azithromycin and metronidazole (Choice A) would treat an infection from Chlamydia trachomatis or trichomoniasis, as well as bacterial vaginosis. However, it does not provide coverage for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is a common cause of PIO. Ciprofloxacin and vancomycin (Choice C) would not appropriately cover the causative organisms of PIO. While ciprofloxacin was previously used to treat Neisseria gonorrhoeae, resistance in the United States is now common. Vancomycin is most commonly used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Clindamycin and ampicillin (Choice D) would treat infections caused primarily by Gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Both Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are Gram-negative organisms, and thus would not be properly treated with clindamycin or ampicillin. Both of these agents do have partial Gram-negative coverage but are insufficient in breadth to cover PIO. Penicillin and tetracycline (Choice E) would not appropriately cover the causative organisms of PIO. While tetracycline can be used in the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis, this pairing of antibiotics does not offer appropriate coverage for Neisseria gonorrhoeae."

",C,"Tension pneumothorax can be a complication of a penetrating thoracic trauma and occurs when air is able to enter the pleural space but is prevented from exiting. Increasing amounts of trapped air in the pleural space compresses the lung parenchyma, creating an inability for the lung to expand and causing it to collapse. As the pneumothorax progresses and continues to increase in size, it can result in tracheal or mediastinal deviation away from the affected hemithorax. It can also result in decreased venous return to the heart, which manifests with hypotension and obstructive shock. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by absent breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion as a result of the increased air in the pleural space displacing normal lung parenchyma along with hemodynamic instability. In cases of acute tension pneumothorax, evacuating the accumulated air via needle decompression and aspiration permits expansion of the lung and eliminates tension on the mediastinum. Immediate needle thoracostomy for decompression is followed by tube thoracostomy, which prevents re-accumulation and promotes repair of the pleural defect.","Chest x-ray (Choice A) and CT scan of the chest (Choice B) are both diagnostic imaging modalities that can disclose a traumatic pneumothorax or hemothorax, rib fractures, pulmonary contusions, or other injuries. However, in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, management should precede diagnostic imaging. In this case, a tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis that should be treated prior to further diagnostic imaging.

Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (Choice D) would not be indicated in this patient prior to emergent needle thoracostomy. Intubation would increase positive pressure and air entry into the pleural space, increasing the severity of mediastinal deviation, hypotension, and obstructive shock. A thoracostomy must be performed to relieve the tension pneumothorax and allow air to escape the pleural space.

Transfusion of packed red blood cells (Choice E) would be indicated in the setting of hemorrhagic shock. However, the cause of this patient's shock is obstructive secondary to a tension pneumothorax preventing venous return to the heart."

F) Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder
",C,"This patient's laboratory panel suggests severe dehydration as the primary aberrancy driving his clinical picture. Features of severe dehydration include hypotension, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, and flat neck veins. His severely increased creatinine concentrations suggests acute prerenal kidney injury, which is caused by ineffective perfusion of the kidneys, whether caused by hypovolemia, as in this case, or hypotension. His hyperglycemia also suggests a high serum osmolality induced by dehydration as does his hypercalcemia. Treatment of dehydration and prerenal kidney injury is with intravenous isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline. This will expand his intravascular volume and improve perfusion to the kidneys. However, if decreased perfusion to the kidneys persists to the point of ischemia, then acute tubular necrosis, a form of intrinsic kidney injury, can develop. Prerenal and intrinsic kidney injury can be distinguished by the fractional excretion of sodium, which is <1 % in prerenal and >2% in intrinsic kidney inJury.","Administration of insulin (Choice A) is not the best first step as the primary cause of his hyperglycemia is dehydration. Administering insulin would be critical if the patient were demonstrating signs of diabetic ketoacidosis. However, he has a normal serum bicarbonate and anion gap at this time. Thus, addressing his dehydration will likely resolve the majority of his hyperglycemia and should be the first step in management.
Administration of metoprolol (Choice B) is not appropriate in this case as the patient is tachycardic as a result of dehydration, not because of a primary arrhythmia. The patient's decreased intravascular volume and consequent decreased stroke volume require tachycardia to maintain cardiac output and hemodynamic stability. If metoprolol were administered, his heart rate would decrease, and he would likely begin to suffer further complications of inadequate perfusion and end-organ ischemia.
CT scan of the head (Choice D) may be warranted as a component of this patient's work-up but is not the most appropriate first step in management. If the patient is still disoriented after correcting his metabolic disturbances, then a CT scan of the head is warranted.
Hemodialysis (Choice E) is indicated when acute kidney injury causes severe acidemia, electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia, volume overload, or uremia. None of these are present in this case. This patient's prerenal kidney injury will likely correct with intravenous fluid administration.
Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder (Choice F) is indicated in patients whose acute kidney injury is suspected to be caused by postrenal obstruction causing hydronephrosis, such as nephrolithiasis or an enlarged prostate. This patient's clinical and laboratory picture are more consistent with a prerenal cause."

E) Informed consent is not needed in this situation
",D,"Ensuring informed consent has been obtained is a physician's duty before performing a procedure in a non-emergent setting. Informed consent fulfills the ethics principle of autonomy, which dictates that patients should be able to make their own decisions about their healthcare, including whether to accept or decline a procedure. Informed consent also benefits the physician-patient relationship and encourages physicians to thoroughly review the indications, benefits, and risks of the procedure, and whether alternatives could be considered. Informed consent in this case must include an explanation of the proposed procedure, alternative options, the risks and benefits of the procedure, and the risk of refusing the procedure. In this case, the informed consent process should include discussion of the risk of pneumothorax associated with placement of a subclavian catheter.","Advantages of using a subclavian catheter over a femoral catheter (Choice A) should be considered by the physician when determining the appropriate management of this patient but does not need to be described to the patient as part of the informed consent process. Anticipated length of time intravenous access will be needed (Choice B) is not likely known at this point in the patient's course and does not need to be included in the informed consent. Number of prior central venous catheters placed by the physician (Choice C) is not necessary to disclose as part of the informed consent process. However, it is necessary to disclose to the patient whether trainees such as residents and medical students will participate in the procedure. Informed consent is necessary before any procedure occurs in a non-emergent setting. Thus, it is required in this situation (Choice E) and to forego informed consent would be negligent on the part of the physician."

A) High-sodium diet
B) Lack of exercise
C) Uncontrolled hypertension
D) Untreated hypercholesterolemia
E) Use of an oral contraceptive
",E,"Use of an oral contraceptive is the strongest risk factor for this patient's current condition, which is most consistent with a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the left lower leg with likely embolization to the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary embolism). The cause of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is considered provoked if it occurs after surgery, malignancy, or prolonged immobilization, but is considered unprovoked in situations where there does not appear to be an inciting factor. While this distinction can sometimes be useful in estimating the risk for subsequent VTE events, it is not always useful in clinical practice. Regardless of the cause, all patients should receive chronic anticoagulant medications such as warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, or one of the direct oral anticoagulant medications. Additionally, underlying risk factors for VTE should be addressed. This patient's cigarette use increases her risk for VTE, but the use of oral contraceptives, especially in a patient who smokes cigarettes, confers a substantially higher risk for VTE. This patient should be started on an anticoagulant medication and her oral contraceptives should be discontinued. Additionally, she should receive counseling on tobacco cessation.","High-sodium diet (Choice A), in addition to obesity, can contribute to the development of hypertension, which is apparent in this patient, but a high-sodium diet does not predispose to VTE. Lack of exercise (Choice B) is not a risk factor for VTE, although prolonged periods of immobility such as during international flights may confer some increased risk. Uncontrolled hypertension (Choice C) increases the risk for myocardial infarction and stroke but does not increase the risk for VTE. Untreated hypercholesterolemia (Choice D) increases the risk for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction but does not increase the risk for VTE."

C) Arterial blood gas analysis
D) Endotracheal intubation
E) X-ray of the chest
",D,"Endotracheal intubation is the most appropriate next step in management of the patient's airway in the setting of acute smoke inhalation injury. Smoke inhalation injury should be suspected in patients presenting with facial burns, hoarse voice, wheezing, soot in the airway, strider, or carbonaceous sputum. The inhalation of smoke and additional chemicals in the setting of a fire presents the risk for injury to the pharyngeal, laryngeal, and tracheal mucosa. Resultant inflammation drives the rapid development of mucosal edema, which can cause acute airway obstruction. Airway obstruction is an immediate life-threatening condition that must be managed at or before the time it occurs. If care is not taken to immediately maintain an unobstructed path for air to flow into the tracheobronchial tree, rapid hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death can occur if significant airway edema ensues. Emergent endotracheal intubation is the most appropriate initial step and should be performed immediately to prevent airway obstruction.","Cyanide inhibits the electron transport chain, leading to lactic acidosis, compensatory respiratory alkalosis, hypotension, lethargy, and bradycardia. The management of cyanide poisoning includes supportive care with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, sodium thiosulfate, which increases the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate for renal excretion, amyl nitrites (Choice A) to induce methemoglobinemia, which binds with cyanide and prevents it from acting on the electron transport chain, and hydroxocobalamin (Choice B), which combines with cyanide to create nontoxic cyanocobalamin. This patient may require these interventions but not prior to securing the airway. Arterial blood gas analysis (Choice C) and an x-ray of the chest (Choice E) are not helpful at this time to make further decisions about management. This patient is at risk for imminent airway obstruction as a result of signs of smoke inhalation injury and strider on inspiration, and the next step in management of this patient is endotracheal intubation."

",E,"Needlestick injuries are a common occupational hazard for healthcare workers. These injuries put the worker at risk for inoculation of bloodborne pathogens and subsequent infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Needlestick injuries also put the injured worker at risk for tetanus infection. Following such an injury, the worker should be asked about their previous vaccinations (including hepatitis B and tetanus) and should be counseled on the risks and benefits of HIV prophylaxis. If the patient had not received his hepatitis B vaccine series, he should be treated with vaccination as well as with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). If a patient has received their tetanus vaccine, they should receive a tetanus booster if their last dose was more than 10 years ago for a clean or minor wound or if there has been more than 5 years ago for all other wounds. If they have not received their vaccination for tetanus, they should receive the tetanus immune globulin only for large or dirty wounds. This patient has been vaccinated against hepatitis B, making HBIG unnecessary, and has been vaccinated against tetanus. Since he is unsure when his last tetanus vaccination was performed, he should receive a tetanus booster.","Treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate (Choices A, B, D, and G) is utilized in the management of skin and soft tissue infections, such as those sustained from a bite wound. As this was an overall clean wound without inoculation of the joint capsule, antibiotic therapy is not warranted unless the patient develops signs and symptoms of infection. Hepatitis B immune globulin (Choices B, C, F, and G) is not warranted, as this patient has been previously vaccinated against hepatitis B. No additional treatment is necessary at this time (Choice H) is incorrect, as this patient could be at risk for the development of tetanus given the unknown date of his last tetanus vaccination. Failure to prophylactically immunize this patient could lead to tetanus infection and unnecessary morbidity and mortality."

",D,"The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock defined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and septic shock as a subcategory of sepsis characterized by a vasopressor requirement to maintain mean arterial pressure greater than 65 mm Hg or a serum lactate concentration greater than 2 mmol/L despite fluid resuscitation. Serum lactate concentration is reflective of organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction. The measurement of serum lactate is therefore of prognostic utility for this patient with a clinical presentation concerning for septic arthritis and sepsis, as septic shock is associated with an approximate four-fold increase in mortality (40%) as compared to sepsis alone (10%). These new criteria replaced the previously adopted Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) Criteria, although the SIRS criteria remain widely used in clinical practice.","Blood cultures (Choice A) are useful for the identification of the causative pathogen and for guiding antimicrobial therapy but are not of prognostic significance. Complete blood count (Choice B) may disclose leukocytosis in patients with sepsis. This finding is nonspecific, however, and does not necessarily suggest a dysregulated, life-threatening host response. Serum C-reactive protein concentration (Choice C) is indicative of an acute phase inflammatory response but is nonspecific and of little prognostic significance in patients with septic shock. Serum uric acid concentration (Choice E) is useful for the evaluation of gout.

",C,"This patient has attempted suicide by overdose likely with imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant. Features of tricyclic antidepressant overdose include confusion, delirium, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity. This patient is obtunded and unable to protect her airway. Thus, the first step in stabilizing this patient is to intubate her, even before addressing the underlying cause of her symptoms. Following intubation of this patient, further resuscitation includes the administration of sodium bicarbonate to treat the patient's cardiac toxicity (demonstrated in this case by her prolonged corrected QT interval) and the administration of intravenous fluids to correct her hypotension. A dose of activated charcoal may be given to bind any remaining imipramine but may only be used if the airway is protected. The mainstay of treatment for tricyclic antidepressant overdose is sodium bicarbonate to treat the associated cardiac toxicity and prevent further arrhythmias. A broad set of laboratory analyses should be sent to assess for end-organ dysfunction and co-ingestion.","Administer activated charcoal through a nasogastric tube (Choice A) should not be performed prior to intubation in a patient who is unable to protect their airway. In this patient, activated charcoal can be used following intubation but not before. Administer 50% dextrose solution, intravenously (Choice B) is not indicated prior to intubation outside of suspected cases of profound hypoglycemia. Following intubation, an isotonic fluid such as 0.9% saline should be used for fluid resuscitation to address the patient's hypotension. The administration of excess dextrose in a presumed euglycemic is not necessary and would not assist in improving the patient's hemodynamics. A point-of-care glucose analysis should be obtained on any obtunded patient. Perform emergency hemodialysis (Choice D) is not yet indicated as the patient should be stabilized first and then treated with sodium bicarbonate. Additionally, only select solutes are dialyzable. Gastric lavage (Choice E) is generally contraindicated in the treatment of tricyclic antidepressant overdose as it can worsen the associated cardiac arrhythmias by increasing vagal tone. Gastrointestinal decontamination may be performed through a single dose of activated charcoal, but only after the patient's airway is protected."

",B,"Cardiac arrest can be caused by a variety of conditions, including hypovolemia, hypoxia, acidosis, hypothermia, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, overdose, cardiac tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, hypoglycemia, and tension pneumothorax among others. In this patient with evidence of an upper extremity arteriovenous graft presenting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, there is high suspicion for hyperkalemia as a cause of cardiac arrest as a result of underlying kidney injury. Patients with end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis are prone to electrolyte abnormalities, especially hyperkalemia. Severe hyperkalemia leads to reduced myocardial excitability resulting in repolarization abnormalities, conduction dysfunction, heart block, and bradycardia. These abnormalities can manifest on an ECG with peaked T waves, P-R interval prolongation, loss of P waves, and if severe, widened ORS complexes, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest. Hyperkalemia resulting in ECG changes or cardiac arrest requires the emergent administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride to induce cardiac cell membrane stabilization. Further treatment after calcium may involve insulin and glucose, ~-adrenergic agonists, or bicarbonate to shift potassium into cells, loop diuretics to facilitate the urinary excretion of potassium, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate to promote binding of potassium within the lumen of the gut. For severe or refractory cases, dialysis may be necessary.","Administration of atropine (Choice A), a cholinergic inhibitor, is used in the management of symptomatic bradycardia and in organophosphate toxicity. It has no role in the management of PEA arrest outside of these cases.

Administration of insulin (Choice C) would be helpful for the treatment of hyperkalemia but should be given after the administration of calcium chloride or calcium gluconate for stabilization of the cardiac membrane. Insulin will shift potassium intracellularly to decrease serum potassium concentrations.

Vasopressin (ADH) (Choice D) can be used as a vasopressor due to its vasoconstrictive properties, which increase systemic vascular resistance. It can be used in cases of distributive shock, such as septic shock, but is typically not a first-line vasopressor. It would not be helpful in this patient who is pulseless and in cardiac arrest.

While endotracheal intubation (Choice E) can be helpful in cases of cardiac arrest to secure the airway and prevent or treat hypoxia, the cause of this patient's cardiac arrest is likely hyperkalemia, which should be treated emergently with calcium chloride or gluconate. As well, this patient has a supraglottic airway which is functioning appropriately and will sufficiently supply oxygenation and ventilation to the patient. Endotracheal intubation can be attempted at a later time for a definitive airway, if necessary.

Needle thoracostomy (Choice F) would be helpful if this patient's arrest was caused by a tension pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax can be a complication of penetrating thoracic trauma and occurs when air is able to enter the pleural space but is prevented from exiting. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by absent breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion on the affected side."

These episodes subside with time and are associated with nausea but no vomiting. She has heavy menstrual bleeding treated with oral contraceptive therapy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination discloses epigastric tenderness to palpation with voluntary guarding. Which of the following laboratory results are most likely in this patient?
A) Decreased serum alkaline phosphatase activity
B) Decreased serum urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio
C) Increased serum indirect bilirubin concentration
D) Increased serum lipase activity
E) Positive Helicobacter pylori stool antigen
",D,"Increased serum lipase activity is commonly seen in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis presents with epigastric abdominal pain that radiates to the back, along with nausea and emesis, often in a patient with a history of gallstones, alcoholism, trauma, hypertriglyceridemia, or hypercalcemia. Gallstone pancreatitis may be preceded by other signs of cholelithiasis including biliary colic, as seen in this case. Acute pancreatitis can be complicated by necrosis, hemorrhage, abscess, or the formation of pseudocysts. Laboratory evaluation often shows increased serum amylase and lipase concentrations. Treatment of uncomplicated acute pancreatitis is largely supportive and should include intravenous fluids, either 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer solution, bowel rest, and pain control. Surgical intervention may be required in cases of complications.","Increased, not decreased serum alkaline phosphatase activity (Choice A), is seen in some complications of gallstones such as choledocholithiasis, ascending cholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis can cause a severe inflammatory response accompanied by hypotension leading to a prerenal acute kidney injury. Increased, not decreased serum urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio (Choice B), characterizes this type of kidney injury. Direct, not indirect (Choice C), bilirubin concentration is increased by obstruction of the biliary tree. Direct bilirubin is secreted into the bile canaliculi of the liver and eventually drains into the common bile duct before entering the duodenum. Obstruction of the flow of bile in the setting of choledocholithiasis or ascending cholangitis causes direct bilirubin to leak into the surrounding interstitium and vasculature. Positive Helicobacter pylori stool antigen (Choice E) is seen in patients with peptic ulcer disease induced by Helicobacter pylori infection. While gastric or duodenal ulcers are also a cause of epigastric pain, this patient's history of biliary colic is more suggestive of gallstone pancreatitis."

C) Hyperglycemia nonketotic coma
D) Hypoxemia
E) Medication adverse effect
",B,"Hypercarbia most likely explains this patient's change in mental status during transport to the hospital. Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly develop hypercarbia at baseline as a result of their obstructive disease, but acute exacerbations, which are frequently the result of respiratory tract infections, can lead to an acute worsening of the underlying obstruction. Patients present with increased dyspnea and wheezing, which represents turbulent airflow through the constricted bronchial tree. Concurrent cough and sputum production are also common. When the underlying obstruction is exacerbated by a trigger, patients develop profound air trapping and are less capable of expelling carbon dioxide. On arterial blood gas analysis, this manifests as an increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Severe hypercarbia can lead to lethargy and mental status changes. For this reason, all patients with a COPD exacerbation and altered mental status should be evaluated for the presence of hypercarbia. Treatment involves the administration of bronchodilator medications, steroids, and positive pressure ventilation. Occasionally, intubation is required if the patient becomes obtunded. Additionally, patients with COPD tend to have a lower oxygen saturation at baseline as a result of their underlying pulmonary parenchymal disease. During COPD exacerbations, the goal oxygen saturation should target between 88% to 92%. Historically, administration of supplemental oxygen to raise the saturation beyond this amount has been postulated to blunt respiratory drive, though actual evidence for this is limited. It is probable instead that the administration of supplemental oxygen worsens ventilation-perfusion mismatch in this patient population.","Circulating endotoxins (Choice A) may be present in patients with sepsis. This patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of his COPD and does not have evidence of sepsis.

Hyperglycemic nonketotic coma (Choice C) is incorrect. This patient's symptoms are primarily respiratory, thus his altered mental status is more likely secondary to hypercarbia. A clinical history of hyperglycemia, polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration would also be expected.

Hypoxemia (Choice D) is incorrect. It is common for patients with COPD to have a low oxygen saturation at baseline. This patient's oxygen saturation of 88% corresponds with a partial pressure of oxygen of approximately 55 mm Hg. While this is lower than normal, it would be unlikely to cause altered mental status and may actually be a baseline, around-the-clock saturation for many patients with COPD.

Medication adverse effect (Choice E) is incorrect. Insulin and glyburide can cause hypoglycemia, but this patient would likely have demonstrated altered mental status at the time when the paramedics arrived. Tramadol can also cause lethargy, but symptoms would have been expected at the scene."

",D,"Initiate noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is the most appropriate immediate next step. Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often develop hypercarbia as a consequence of bronchial obstruction and poor ventilation. Initial treatment should focus on dilating the airways with the use of ~-adrenergicagonist medications such as albuterol. Additionally, antimuscarinic agents such as ipratropium can be given along with oral or intravenous steroids. In some instances, hypercarbia persists despite these interventions. These patients benefit from the use of NIPPV. This type of ventilation includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). In bilevel modes, both the inspiratory and expiratory pressure can be set to augment the patient's ventilation. The expiratory pressure helps to maintain patency of the airway during expiration in an attempt to combat the collapse of the airway that is common to patients with COPD. This type of assisted ventilation frequently results in resolution of hypercarbia, but only patients who are awake enough to cooperate with the machine are candidates for its use.","Administer ceftriaxone and azithromycin (Choice A) is incorrect. This combination of antibiotics is appropriate for the treatment of patients who are suspected to have community acquired pneumonia. This patient presents with a COPD exacerbation and requires NIPPV to treat his hypercarbia.
Administer naloxone (Choice B) is incorrect. Naloxone is an opiate-reversal agent that is given to patients who are thought to have overdosed on opiates. This patient has no history of opiate use.
Administer 0.9% saline (Choice C) is not correct. This patient requires NIPPV, not intravenous fluids.
Switch from nasal cannula to nonrebreather mask (Choice E) is incorrect. A nonrebreather mask delivers more oxygen than a nasal cannula, but this will not correct the underlying obstructive ventilation problem, which is more amenable to treatment with NIPPV."

A) Acid reflux
B) Coagulopathy
C) Esophageal rupture
D) Helicobacter pylori infection
E) Varices
",E,"Varices secondary to cirrhosis is the most likely cause of this patient's bleeding. Major causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) include peptic ulcer disease, Mallory-Weiss tear, gastritis, and Dieulafoy lesion among others, but few etiologies cause hemorrhage as dramatic and potentially catastrophic as ruptured esophageal varices. This patient has evidence of decompensated cirrhosis with a distended abdomen and fluid wave indicating ascites. Both ascites and esophageal varices are consequences of portal venous hypertension, which occurs as a result of obstruction of flow through the sinusoids within the liver. All patients with bleeding esophageal varices should have two large-bore intravenous catheters inserted for the administration of isotonic crystalloids and packed red blood cells (pRBCs). This patient continues to have signs of hemorrhagic shock despite adequate fluid resuscitation; thus, he should also receive pRBCs. Additionally, patients with bleeding varices should receive intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, an octreotide infusion, and a proton pump inhibitor. Initial care should focus on stabilizing the patient to facilitate upper endoscopy, at which point varices can be ligated for definitive source control and to prevent further bleeding.","Acid reflux (Choice A) does not independently cause hemorrhage and is not the cause of this patient's hemorrhagic shock. Common symptoms of acid reflux include retrosternal pain after meals or in the supine position.
Coagulopathy (Choice B) is not the cause of this patient's bleeding, although a baseline coagulopathy is common in patients with cirrhosis. Even though the international normalized ratio (INR) may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, these patients may be prone to either abnormal clotting or bleeding.
Esophageal rupture (Choice C) presents with severe retrosternal pain and signs of sepsis, not gastrointestinal bleeding. Esophageal rupture may occur as a result of trauma, instrumentation during endoscopy, or from violent retching.
Helicobacter pylori infection (Choice D) causes peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, which may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but it does not frequently cause life-threatening hemorrhage and is more likely to present with epigastric pain and melena."

D) Placement of a large-bore nasogastric tube
E) Placement of the patient on her side
",C,"Initial examination of a patient in distress should include an evaluation of the airway, breathing, and circulation. The most common reasons for urgent endotracheal intubation are an inability to protect the airway, apnea, hypoxemia, and hypercarbia, although other reasons also exist. These include dynamic airway changes in the setting of neck trauma or hematoma, inhalational injuries, and anaphylaxis or angioedema. This patient is lethargic with absent protective airway reflexes (eg, gag reflex), which puts her at an increased risk for aspiration. Aspiration occurs when gastric or oropharyngeal contents enter the airway, which can lead to pneumonitis or pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia presents with cough, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and abnormal breath sounds. Chest x-ray will exhibit patchy infiltrates, most commonly in the right lower lobe if the patient was upright while the aspiration occurred, or the posterior, gravity-dependent portions of the lungs if the patient was supine. Therefore, in order to prevent this patient from aspirating and developing consequent aspiration pneumonia, rapid sequence endotracheal intubation should occur.","Administration of prophylactic antibiotics (Choice A) for aspiration pneumonia may be considered in this patient once she is clinically stable, although the evidence for prophylactic antibiotics in aspiration is mixed. Additionally, endotracheal intubation will be more beneficial in preventing aspiration before it occurs.
Continuous observation (Choice B) is inappropriate, as this patient is unable to protect her airway and is thus at risk for significant aspiration. Urgent endotracheal intubation should occur as soon as possible.
Placement of a large-bore nasogastric tube (Choice D) may be warranted in this patient as a way of removing the contents of her stomach. However, placing a large-bore tube through the gastroesophageal junction in an obtunded patient without a secure airway greatly increases the risk for aspiration. Therefore, endotracheal intubation should occur first.
Placement of the patient on her side (Choice E) may decrease the amount of aspiration if the patient is vomiting. However, it is a temporary solution and does not protect the airway from the aspiration of smaller oropharyngeal contents to the degree that endotracheal intubation does."

",C,"Intravenous fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline is the most appropriate first step for this patient with hypotension who recently suffered a syncopal event. The cause of syncope is variable and may occur as a result of reflex or neural-mediated causes, ventricular arrhythmias, or orthostasis. While syncope is often benign, it is important to obtain an ECG to evaluate for cardiac causes of syncope, such as ventricular arrhythmias or structural heart disease including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this should only be done after appropriate fluid resuscitation has been started. In patients with hypotension, such as this patient, attempts should be made to restore intravascular volume with the intravenous administration of isotonic crystalloids. While this patient's underlying condition causing abdominal pain remains undifferentiated, she should receive fluid resuscitation while undergoing a workup for her abdominal pain. Additional diagnostic studies should follow the correction of her vital sign abnormalities.","Acute abdominal series (Choice A) may ultimately be utilized to further delineate the cause of this patient's abdominal pain, but it should follow appropriate fluid resuscitation.

This patient's symptoms, history of cholelithiasis, and increased lipase concentration are more suggestive of acute pancreatitis.
Methylprednisolone (Choice C), a glucocorticoid, is not indicated in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. It may have a role in therapy for fulminant liver failure, though this patient's mild increases in liver enzymes does not indicate a failing liver.
N-acetylcysteine (Choice D) is indicated for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. There are no features of this patient's history that suggest her current symptoms are induced by acetaminophen.

",B,"Alcohol use disorder causes changes in the expression of central nervous system y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate receptor subunits, leading to sympathetic hyperactivity in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Initially, this hyperexcitability results in tremors, anxiety, diaphoresis, hypertension, tachycardia, and nausea. Within hours of the last drink, alcoholic hallucinosis (auditory or visual hallucinations without confusion or autonomic instability) and seizures (as a result of cortical hyperactivity) can occur. Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, involves severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure with hyperthermia). As a result of their activating effect on GABA receptors, benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are effective in reducing the psychomotor hyperactivity associated with alcohol withdrawal. Long-acting benzodiazepines are preferred because they reduce the risk for recurrent seizures. Many centers employ a symptom-based approach to the treatment of alcohol withdrawal using clinical assessment tools such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar) scale .","Atenolol (Choice A) should not be used to treat alcohol withdrawal, as its efficacy for reducing seizures is less well-characterized than that of benzodiazepines. It may also mask the signs of hemodynamic instability that are associated with delirium tremens. Haloperidol (Choice C) is contraindicated for most patients with alcohol withdrawal, as it lowers the threshold for seizures. Treatment with anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin (Choice D) or valproic acid (Choice E), is not typically necessary for seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal and does not address the underlying cause of the seizures. Benzodiazepine or barbiturate doses, in escalation, are most appropriate."
98,"(qid: 0098) A 61-year-old man with previously stable angina pectoris comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of worsening chest pain. The pain occurs at rest or with minimal exertion. He rates the pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale. Nitroglycerin has provided only moderate relief. He has not had diaphoresis, nausea, or dyspnea. He has coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He has no history of liver disease or bleeding problems. In addition to nitroglycerin, medications include glyburide, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 85 kg (188 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.3¬°C (99.1 ¬°F), pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/68 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. A chest x-ray shows minimal cardiomegaly. An ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads not seen on previous ECGs. Serum cardiac enzyme concentrations are within the reference ranges. The patient is given 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. Morphine (4 mg) is administered, and the patient is pain-free. In addition to administration of aspirin, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A) Administration of heparin
B) Administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
C) Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation
D) Referral to a cardiac surgeon
E) Ventilation-perfusion lung scans

",A,"Administration of heparin is the next most appropriate step. This 61-year-old patient with a history of stable angina but with new onset chest pain at rest and T-wave inversions in the anterior leads most likely has unstable angina. There are three primary categories of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): unstable angina (UA), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A STEMI presents with chest pain, ST elevations on ECG, and positive cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin). Treatment is with thrombolytics or immediate cardiac catheterization. UA and NSTEMI are similar conditions and present with ECG changes such as T-wave inversions or ST segment depressions and chest pain but are differentiated by the presence (NSTEMI) or absence (UA) of increased cardiac biomarkers. Regardless, UA and NSTEMI are treated similarly with dual antiplatelet therapy and full dose anticoagulation. Appropriate anticoagulant choices include either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Patients are then typically risk stratified using various scoring models to determine the urgency of cardiac catheterization, but most will undergo catheterization within 24 hours.","Administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (Choice B) is appropriate for patients with a STEMI who do not have immediate access to a cardiac catheterization suite. Thrombolytics are not given for UA or NSTEMI.
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (Choice C) is used as an adjunctive measure in patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to ACS. This patient does not have evidence of cardiogenic shock.
Referral to a cardiac surgeon (Choice D) is not appropriate at this time. The patient should first be treated with anticoagulants and antiplatelets followed by cardiac catheterization. In patients with multivessel coronary disease not amenable to cardiac stent placement, coronary artery bypass graft surgery is an alternative option.
Ventilation-perfusion lung scan (Choice E) is one imaging modality used to diagnose a pulmonary embolism (PE). While this patient's symptoms could be secondary to a PE, his known cardiac disease, worsening chest pain, and new ECG changes are more consistent with unstable angina."
270,"(qid: 0270) During a routine health maintenance examination, a 15-year-old girl says that she has used marijuana with friends on four occasions. She is healthy and doing well in school. She requests that her parents not be told about the marijuana use.

",C,"Parental consent is required for most medical care of minors (patients younger than age 18 years). Exceptions include medical care related to sexual activities (eg, sexually transmitted infection, contraception, pregnancy care), substance use, and life-threatening medical or psychiatric conditions. (Emancipated minors may make their own medical decisions.) For these sensitive or time-sensitive issues, patient confidentiality and autonomy is favored over other ethical principles. Respecting a patient's wishes about disclosure of medical information can build therapeutic alliance and increase the chance that patients will continue to share sensitive information in the future. As such, the physician should respect this patient's wishes to keep her marijuana use confidential. The physician should establish regular follow-up visits to monitor for adverse consequences of marijuana use (eg, cognitive impairment, psychosis) and the development of a use disorder.","Referral to a psychologist for treatment of substance use disorder (Choice A) would be premature. This patient does not show signs of a use disorder, which commonly include using a substance more than planned, failed attempts to cut back use, and negative psychosocial consequences (eg, relationship conflict). The physician should monitor this patient longitudinally for the development of marijuana use disorder.

Scheduling a family conference (Choice B) would oppose this patient's wishes and violate the ethical principle of autonomy. From a legal standpoint, physicians do not need to inform a patient's parents about medical care related to substance use. Respecting this patient's wish to not disclose her marijuana use to her parents would build therapeutic alliance.

Screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (Choice D) is not clinically indicated. HPV screening typically begins at age 25 years. Also, this patient's marijuana use does not necessarily mean she is engaging in high-risk sexual activity.

Urine toxicology screening (Choice E) may provide useful information about the full scope of the patient's substance use in the future. However, this patient appears to be sharing honestly about her current substance use. Performing urine toxicology screening as a first step is likely to rupture the therapeutic relationship and decrease the chance this patient candidly shares sensitive information and collaborates in treatment planning in the future."
