",C,"Septic arthritis classically presents with a painful, erythematous, swollen joint along with systemic signs and symptoms of illness such as fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea. Septic arthritis results from a bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. The affected joint discloses pain upon passive range of motion, swelling, and erythema on physical examination. Arthrocentesis is indicated for the evaluation of monoarticular erythema and swelling to evaluate for septic arthritis, which characteristically reveals purulent synovial fluid with greater than 50,000 leukocytes/mm3. Serum tests may also show leukocytosis and increased inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein concentration and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Treatment involves urgent intravenous antibiotics with patients often requiring surgical irrigation of the joint. In this case, the most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis because of the patient's presentation of increased temperature and erythematous joint with pain upon passive range of motion in the absence of reported trauma. The most appropriate next step in management is aspiration of the knee joint to perform joint fluid analysis.","Measurement of serum uric acid concentration (Choice A) could be a reasonable step in management in cases of suspected gout. Gout is an inflammatory arthropathy incited by hyperuricemia, with deposition of uric acid crystals inside the joint and surrounding tissues. Gout typically presents after consumption of a purine-rich meal or alcohol, which competes with renal excretion of uric acid. Microscopic examination of joint aspiration would typically show negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals and a leukocyte count less than 50,000/mm3.

MRI of the knee (Choice B) can be useful in cases of traumatic injuries affecting the ligament, tendon, and/or meniscus of the knee. In this case, the patient did not sustain any trauma. Septic arthritis is the most likely diagnosis because of the patient's presentation of increased temperature, erythematous knee joint, and pain with passive range of motion. Aspiration of the knee joint is the most appropriate next step in management.

Intra-articular injection of corticosteroid (Choice D) can be utilized in cases of knee osteoarthritis. In the setting of possible septic arthritis, intra-articular injection of corticosteroids is contraindicated. Further workup with aspiration of the knee joint is the most appropriate next step in management.

Naproxen therapy (Choice E) may be a reasonable treatment option in acute gout or osteoarthritis. In this case, there is concern for septic arthritis. Joint aspiration with subsequent analysis of joint fluid is the most appropriate next step in management."

",E,"Headaches that occur in the morning, daytime sleepiness, and loud snoring are frequently reported by patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This patient is likely experiencing sleep-related hypoventilation as a result of OSA. Clinical features of untreated OSA include excessive daytime fatigue, falling asleep at inappropriate times, loud snoring, and a disrupted sleep-wake cycle. Risk factors include male sex, obesity, congenital or traumatic anatomic abnormalities of the oropharynx and upper airway, neuromuscular disorders, and use of sedating medications. Untreated OSA is associated with hypertension. Diagnosis is made via polysomnography testing. Management consists of lifestyle changes (e.g., weight loss, dietary modifications, increased activity, changing sleep position), avoiding sedating medications and substances, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) while sleeping. Second-line therapies include oral appliances, such as mandibular advancement devices for symptoms refractory to CPAP use, and surgery for cases with obstructing lesions of the airway. Chronic, untreated OSA can result in pulmonary hypertension, which may manifest with heart murmurs or loud pulmonic heart sounds and eventual right-sided heart failure.","ECG (Choice A) is not the most appropriate next step in management. While the patient has a history of hypertension and some cardiac risk factors, he has no symptoms that are indicative of cardiac origin. The loud pulmonic S2 is indicative of pulmonary hypertension likely caused by OSA. ECG would not be effective in diagnosing OSA in this patient, though it may show right-sided chamber hypertrophy. Echocardiography (Choice B) is not the most appropriate next step in management, though it may be indicated following polysomnography. This patient's presentation raises suspicion for increased right-sided cardiac pressures, which would be diagnosed definitively with echocardiography, though he shows no other signs or symptoms at present. Patients with congestive heart failure have shortness of breath, edema, and potentially jugular venous distension. This patient does not display any of these symptoms or signs. Methylphenidate therapy (Choice C) or modafinil therapy (Choice D) are not commonly used for patients with daytime somnolence outside of narcolepsy or central apnea/injury. While methylphenidate or modafinil therapy is used to help wakefulness in the right patient population, such as some post-stroke or traumatic brain injury patients, this would not address the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms. Sleep positioning therapy (Choice F) may be an appropriate adjunct for this patient with likely OSA, but not prior to establishing the diagnosis. While this patient shows many signs and symptoms of OSA and positional sleep therapy may help, the severity of this patient's OSA needs to be characterized to identify an appropriate treatment. For this reason, it is more appropriate to obtain a polysomnogram as the next step in management."

A) Bone density test
B) Renal ultrasonography
C) Serum parathyroid hormone concentration
D) Urinary calcium concentration
E) X-ray of the spine
",C,"Primary hyperparathyroidism presents with hypercalcemia (which in turn presents with nephrolithiasis, chronic bone pain, abdominal discomfort, and psychiatric disturbances), hypophosphatemia, subperiosteal bone resorption, and end-stage kidney disease. Excessive production of parathyroid hormone results in increased serum calcium concentration from increased osteoclast activity, intestinal calcium absorption, and renal calcium reabsorption. In this case, measuring the serum parathyroid hormone concentration can help identify the source of the patient's hypercalcemia.","Bone density test (Choice A) is not the most appropriate next step for this patient. While this patient does meet screening criteria for osteoporosis given her age and sex, a DEXA scan to evaluate her bone health will not lend information toward why she has an increased calcium concentration. Because of this, serum parathyroid hormone concentrations should be assessed first.

Renal ultrasonography (Choice B) is not necessary for this patient. This could lend information as to whether the patient has evidence of kidney disease, as a potential explanation for her increased creatinine concentration. However, measurement of serum parathyroid hormone concentration is more appropriate to assess the origin of her hypercalcemia, and additional testing could follow this if indicated.

Urinary calcium concentration (Choice D) is not necessary currently. Patients with chronic kidney disease commonly have increased excretion of calcium in the urine as they are unable to resorb and maintain serum concentrations over time. However, this would not provide further diagnostic information about the underlying cause of her condition.

X-ray of the spine (Choice E) is not appropriate at this time. Patients with multiple myeloma can have increased calcium, bone pain, anemia, and end-stage renal disease. X-ray of the spine can help assist in diagnosis and identification of lesions. However, it is more appropriate to assess this patient's current parathyroid hormone concentration to identify the source of her hypercalcemia."

C) Smoking cessation
D) Weight loss of 9 kg (20 lb)
E) Biofeedback
F) Vitamin E supplementation
",D,"Weight loss of 9 kg (20 lb) is the most effective intervention to decrease this patient's blood pressure. On average, for patients who are overweight or diagnosed with obesity, the loss of 0.45 kg (1 lb) of body weight correlates with a drop in mean blood pressure by around 1 mm Hg. Continued aerobic exercise at least several times per week will also help reduce this patient's blood pressure. Other interventions that are frequently helpful include dietary salt restriction, although many patients with essential hypertension will eventually require pharmacologic therapy to reduce their blood pressure below the current goal of 130/80 mm Hg. Particularly in young patients or those with ongoing hypertension despite the use of three medications including a diuretic, screening for causes of secondary hypertension should be considered.","Abstinence from alcohol (Choice A) is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on blood pressure in this patient who only drinks one beer daily. Male patients with hypertension who drink three or more drinks per day should be advised to reduce their intake to two or fewer drinks per day. Abstinence from coffee (Choice B) is unlikely to affect this patient's blood pressure in a significant manner. The association between caffeine intake and long-term blood pressure is unclear, but regular intake of coffee is not thought to contribute to the development of primary hypertension. There may be a transient increase in the patient's blood pressure following consumption of caffeine; however, this will generally be brief and in temporal association with the duration of action of caffeine. Smoking cessation (Choice C) is unlikely to affect this patient's blood pressure in the long term. Smoking has been shown to raise blood pressure transiently, while smoking the cigarette and in the minutes following, because of increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The effect on the blood pressure is transient with pressure returning to baseline within 10 to 15 minutes of finishing the cigarette. There has been no clear association between smoking and the development of chronic hypertension. Biofeedback (Choice E) is a mind-body technique that uses visual and/or auditory feedback in an attempt to gain control over involuntary bodily functions. It is not a proven means of reducing chronic hypertension. Vitamin E supplementation (Choice F) is unlikely to significantly affect this patient's blood pressure. There is some evidence that vitamin E supplementation may cause a slight decrease in the systolic blood pressure of patients with mild hypertension, but no overall effect has been found on diastolic blood pressure or mean arterial pressure. The effect on systolic blood pressure is not as significant as is seen with weight loss."

",A,"Depression screening is a routine preventive health measure recommended for all adults. However, elderly adults are under screened for depression. As depression is relatively prevalent in older adults and easily treatable, routine depression screening should occur. Other screening in elderly patients includes screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in men aged 65 to 75 years, breast cancer for women older than age 40 years with a life expectancy more than 5 years, and colorectal cancer for adults older than age 45 years with a life expectancy greater than 5 years. This patient is advanced in age, so cancer screenings are unlikely to be beneficial. Patients older than age 65 years should also be counseled about a healthy lifestyle, including regular aerobic exercise, a diet heavy in healthy fats, and smoking cessation.","Obtain serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration (Choice B) is not a routine screening test in older patients. Also, thyroid-stimulating hormone derangements are likely to present with physical examination findings such as skin or hair changes. This patient's physical examination disclosed no abnormalities.

Order mammography (Choice C) is unlikely to be beneficial in patients with a life expectancy of less than 5 years. Many patients with breast cancer, especially in the early stages, survive longer than 5 years. This patient's advanced age makes breast cancer screening unlikely to be helpful.

Order mental status examination (Choice D) is incorrect. Any physician can perform a mental status examination. Physicians should regularly monitor their patients' mental status for behavior, affect, mood, and cognitive changes. No order is needed for this patient.

Schedule a follow-up DEXA scan now (Choice E) is not necessary. DEXA scans should be repeated every 2 years for patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. This patient had a relatively recent DEXA scan."

",D,"Loose stool in the setting of hard stool in the rectal vault and increased stool burden suggests overflow diarrhea in the setting of severe constipation. Chronic, severe constipation with fecal impaction in the rectum can occur in the setting of decreased mobility, opiate use, or anticholinergic (eg, oxybutynin) use, which suppresses bowel peristalsis and increases the risk for constipation. This patient's episode of loose stool occurred because only liquid can pass adjacent to the impacted stool. The first-line treatment for severe constipation with fecal impaction is administration of an enema. This works by introducing fluid into the large bowel, which serves to expand the intestinal tract lumen, soften the impacted stool, and stimulate peristalsis. Modification of risk factors should also occur, such as increasing fiber in the diet, limiting the use of opiate medications, or introducing stool softeners or osmotic agents into the medication regimen.","Adhesions (Choice A) are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction in a patient with a history of prior intra-abdominal surgery. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents with nausea, vomiting, constipation, obstipation, abdominal pain, and abdominal distension. This patient has a soft abdomen without distension, making small bowel obstruction less likely. Firm stool in the rectal vault is more suggestive of fecal impaction.

Colon cancer (Choice B) most commonly occurs in the rectosigmoid region of the large bowel. Lesions within the ascending colon, by convention, typically result in slow bleeding, leading to iron deficiency anemia. Cancers within the descending and rectosigmoid colon are more likely to be infiltrative, resulting in obstruction of the large bowel. Patients may have thin-appearing stool. Loose stool with firm stool in the rectal vault is more suggestive of fecal impaction. In this patient with a normal colonoscopy 3 years ago, colon cancer so severe to cause constipation is unlikely.

Diverticulitis (Choice C) presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, fever, and tenderness to palpation over the left lower quadrant. It is less likely to present with constipation. This patient does not have fever or focal tenderness, and has diffuse abdominal tenderness, making diverticulitis less likely.

Ischemic bowel (Choice E), such as with ischemic colitis, refers to inadequate blood supply to the colon, which can lead to bowel wall necrosis, loss of immune barriers, and bowel perforation. Ischemic colitis most commonly occurs in the setting of atherosclerosis, resulting in plaque rupture within a mesenteric vessel, systemic hypotension (e.g., shock), or emboli such as in atrial fibrillation. Typical symptoms of patients with acute ischemic colitis include crampy abdominal pain, tenderness over the affected bowel, and hematochezia. This patient does not have focal tenderness, hematochezia, or risk factors for ischemic colitis, making this diagnosis less likely.

Volvulus (Choice F) such as sigmoid volvulus results from twisting of the sigmoid mesentery, which can lead to large bowel obstruction and potential rupture or intestinal necrosis if not treated. It typically shows a coffee-bean appearance on abdominal x-rays. Sigmoid volvulus generally presents in an older patient with increasing abdominal distention, abdominal pain, constipation, and possible obstipation. This patient has a soft abdomen without distension and a sensation of fullness and discomfort, not severe abdominal pain, making sigmoid volvulus less likely."

",A,"This patient is likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Symptoms of MDD include 2 or more weeks of at least five of the following symptoms: depressed mood, anhedonia (eg, decreased interest in exercising or socializing), guilt or worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, psychomotor slowing or agitation, suicidal thoughts, and/or neurovegetative symptoms (eg, decreased energy, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance). These symptoms disrupt everyday functioning. This patient demonstrates anhedonia and decreased energy despite his recovery from surgery several months ago. Though some patients are able to express a depressed mood, others (particularly men, patients over the age of 65 years, and African American patients) may not initially report a depressed mood and/or may present with primarily somatic symptoms. Treatment of MDD should include psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.","Determination of ankle brachial indices (Choice B) would assist in diagnosing peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD commonly presents with extremity pain with activity and weak pulses. Edema, as seen in this patient, is uncommon. Also, this patient demonstrates a constellation of symptoms consistent with MDD.

Determination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (Choice C) would assist in assessing for systemic inflammation. Though erythrocyte sedimentation rate is commonly measured in patients presenting with fatigue who have other focal symptoms that indicate an inflammatory process (eg, joint pain), this patient's fatigue is likely caused by MDD as he has multiple symptoms suggestive of MDD. He does not report focal symptoms other than pedal edema, which is a known complication of coronary artery bypass surgery involving saphenous vein harvesting.

Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities (Choice D) assists in diagnosing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Symptoms and signs include unilateral lower extremity edema, skin pigmentation changes, pain, vein dilation, and venous ulcer formation. This patient shows bilateral pedal edema and lacks other typical signs of DVT. Fatigue and anhedonia are not common DVT symptoms.

Echocardiography (Choice E) can be used to evaluate for systolic or diastolic dysfunction, intravascular volume status, and pericardial effusion. It is commonly used to determine the severity of a patient's heart failure. Though bilateral pedal edema is a sign of heart failure exacerbation, this patient feels physically well and does not report symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnea or orthopnea. His bilateral pedal edema is likely secondary to the coronary artery bypass surgery, as saphenous vein harvesting can lead to pedal edema. Also, he reports anhedonia, which is more consistent with MDD than congestive heart failure."

Supplementation with which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?
A) Calcium
B) Folic acid
C) Magnesium
D) Manganese
E) Vitamin A
",A,"In this patient who has recently converted to a vegan diet, it is most appropriate to begin supplementation with calcium. Patients who follow vegan diets are at increased risk for deficiencies of iron, calcium, zinc, protein, fatty acids, and vitamin B12 (cobalamin). Given that these patients do not have consistent intake of these essential vitamins and minerals, it is appropriate to begin supplementation even prior to the emergence of any symptoms or signs of deficiency. In these patients, the low intake of dietary calcium increases the total body concentration of parathyroid hormone as well as vitamin D. This causes a reuptake of calcium from the bones to maintain appropriate serum concentrations. Over time, this can lead to low bone density and subsequent pathologic fractures.","Folic acid (Choice B) supplementation is not necessary at this time. Patients who follow vegan or vegetarian diets are not generally at risk for folate deficiency. This is because high concentrations of folate can be found in green leafy vegetables, which the patient is regularly consuming.

Magnesium (Choice C) supplementation is not necessary at this time. Patients who follow vegan or vegetarian diets are not generally at risk for magnesium deficiency. This is because high concentrations of magnesium can be found in green leafy vegetables, beans, kale, spinach, bananas, and avocados.

Manganese (Choice D) supplementation is not necessary in this patient. Patients who follow vegan or vegetarian diets are not generally at risk for manganese deficiency. This is because many foods that are part of these diets are high in manganese. Some examples of these are whole grains, quinoa, almonds, hazelnuts, chickpeas, spinach, and tofu. Vitamin A (Choice E) supplementation is not necessary in this patient. Patients who follow vegan or vegetarian diets are not generally at risk for Vitamin A deficiency. This is because many foods that are part of these diets are high in Vitamin A, such as sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, kale, squash, and cantaloupe."

",H,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive diplococcus and is the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Typical signs of pneumococcal pneumonia include fever, chills, productive cough, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Physical examination may show rhonchi, crackles, decreased breath sounds, and increased tactile fremitus, such as in this patient. X-rays commonly show a lobar consolidation, commonly, bronchopneumonia. Management of community-acquired pneumonia includes antibiotics. Depending on severity and patient risk factors, the condition may require supplemental oxygen or mechanical respiratory support, intravenous antibiotics, and admission. Acute bacterial pneumonia may occur in isolation or following a viral respiratory syndrome, as in this case.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Choice A) presents with hilar adenopathy and calcified pulmonary granulomas in primary infection. In reactivation, patients present with apical pulmonary opacities and fever, night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis. This patient does not have night sweats or risk factors for tuberculosis infection, making this an unlikely causal organism.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Choice B) is an atypical organ sm that can cause pneumonia, which usually presents with fevers, cough, and infiltrates on chest x-ray. Clinical examination findings typically show abnormal breath sounds. It is a common atypical bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia in young adults, resulting in the development of alveolar and interstitial infiltrates on chest imaging. This patient has a lobar infiltrate on chest imaging, making S. pneumoniae the most likely causal organism.

Neisseria meningitidis (Choice C) infection usually causes meningococcemia or meningitis. It typically presents acutely with fever, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, myalgias, and a diffuse petechial rash. It can quickly evolve to florid shock accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation. This patient has pneumonia, making S. pneumoniae the most likely causal organism.

Pneumocystis jiroveci (Choice D) is a common opportunistic cause of pneumonia in patients with late-stage HIV infection and/or AIDS. It is a yeast-like fungal organism that can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Chest imaging typically shows diffuse, bilateral infiltrates often prominently about the hila. This patient is not immunocompromised and has lobar pneumonia, making P. jiroveci an unlikely causal organism.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Choice E) is a gram-negative rod that causes a variety of infections, including pneumonia and bacteremia. It is more associated with hospital-acquired or ventilator-acquired pneumonia. This patient does not have a history of hospitalization or ventilation, so P. aeruginosa is a less likely causal organism. S. pneumoniae is the most likely causal organism for community-acquired pneumonia.

Respiratory syncytial virus (Choice F) and rhinovirus (Choice G) commonly result in acute bronchiolitis in children or an upper respiratory tract infection in adults. Pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus is usually an atypical pneumonia with diffuse opacities. This patient has a lobar consolidation, making a bacterial cause more likely."

",C,"Gout is an acute, monoarticular arthropathy resulting from an intra-articular inflammatory reaction to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals. Gout typically presents with atraumatic joint pain, erythema, and swelling. The most common joint involved is the first metatarsophalangeal, but other common joints include the knees and elbows. Increased intake of foods that are rich in purines such as seafood and red meats have been shown to increase the risk for gout flares, as they result in increased production of uric acid. Other causes of increased uric acid concentration include diuretic use, tumor lysis syndrome, alcohol consumption, and obesity. Arthrocentesis is performed and microscopic examination of the synovial fluid generally shows a leukocyte count of 10,000-50,000/mm3 with a mixture of neutrophils and lymphocytes, and needle-like, birefringent crystals. Treatment of an acute flare consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen or indomethacin as well as colchicine, or corticosteroids. In this case, the patient is most likely presenting with a gout flare because of the sudden onset of his symptoms. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy is indomethacin for this patient who previously did not tolerate colchicine.","Allopurinol (Choice A) and probenecid (Choice E) are both urate-lowering medications. Allopurinol functions by inhibiting xanthine oxidase and probenecid functions by decreasing the reabsorption of urate. These medications are important pharmaceutical options in preventing gout flares. In this case, the patient is presenting with an acute gout flare and the most appropriate drug for treatment is indomethacin. Codeine (Choice B) is an opiate medication used for pain management or cough in a select group of patients. In cases of acute gout flares, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and/or corticosteroids are the first-line treatments for pain relief and management. Indomethacin would be the most appropriate drug for treating this acute gout flare. Prednisone (Choice D) is often not the most recommended initial therapy for the treatment of an acute gout flare. Because of its side effect profile, most clinicians recommend the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or colchicine initially. While corticosteroids can be given for acute gout flares, these other medications are typically administered first."

",B,"This older patient with a pulsatile abdominal mass has examination findings consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAAs are most commonly seen in male smokers with a family or personal history of atherosclerotic disease. They commonly occur in the infrarenal abdominal aorta and may present as a palpable, pulsatile abdominal mass if the aneurysm is large and the patient is a healthy weight. Smoking is the modifiable risk factor most strongly associated with both development of an AAA as well as its expansion and rupture. Uncontrolled hypertension has been shown to be associated with increased rate of expansion and rupture as well, although the association is less strong. Ruptured aneurysms require emergent surgical intervention and repair. Chronic aneurysms are typically asymptomatic. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends using ultrasonography to screen for AAA in men age 65 to 75 years who have a history of tobacco use.","Alcohol consumption (Choice A) has variable effects on AAA development. Small amounts of moderate alcohol consumption have been shown to reduce risk for AAA development, while high levels (more than 2 drinks/day) of alcohol consumption may slightly increase the risk. This patient has a moderate level of alcohol consumption, which would not contribute to his risk for developing an AAA and may even be protective. Alcohol consumption has not been shown to affect the rate of AAA rupture.

Ethnicity (Choice C) has been associated with the prevalence of AAA, but not with risk for rupture or expansion. AAAs develop most frequently in White patients; however, AAA can develop in patients of any ethnicity.

Hemoglobin A1c measurement (Choice D) would not be predictive of future complications in this patient. Diabetes is associated with a lower risk for the development of an AAA, as well as AAA expansion and rupture.

Serum total cholesterol concentration (Choice E) does contribute to the development of an AAA, but there is no association between hyperlipidemia and AAA expansion and rupture"

",B,"Overflow incontinence occurs when bladder emptying is impaired, eventually resulting in intravesical hydrostatic pressure overcoming internal and external urinary sphincter dosing pressures, thereby causing the leakage of urine. It can occur due to a variety of causes, including neurologic insults (eg, diabetic neuropathy, stroke, trauma, multiple sclerosis) that result in bladder atony, and bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia or a bladder mass. This patient's long history of type 1 diabetes mellitus increases her risk for diabetic neuropathy and overflow incontinence secondary to neurogenic bladder. Patients develop urinary retention with an inability to void and may have loss of urine with Valsalva maneuver or increased abdominopelvic pressure. The diagnosis is established with a urodynamic study, which typically shows an increased postvoid residual volume, such as in this patient with a postvoid residual volume of 800 ml. In contrast to an overactive bladder, which is treated with oxybutynin, overflow incontinence is treated with bethanechol, a muscarinic agent that promotes bladder contraction, or with intermittent catheterization.","Functional incontinence (Choice A) describes incontinence secondary to external factors or another condition creating inability to void in a timely manner or inability to recognize the need to void. Several causes of functional incontinence include cognitive disorders such as dementia, movement disorders such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson disease, physical barriers, or medication effect. This patient has no evidence of a secondary cause of incontinence. Rather, she shows signs of a primary cause of incontinence, overflow incontinence, as evidenced by increased postvoid residual volume.

Stress incontinence (Choice C) is incontinence that is triggered by an increase in intra-abdominal pressure (eg, lifting, sneezing, Valsalva maneuver). Stress incontinence results from urethral hypermobility caused by pelvic floor weakness/prolapse or intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Urethral hypermobility is evidenced on physical examination by deviation greater than 30 degrees from the horizontal of an inserted cotton-tipped applicator with straining. This patient's physical examination is normal, making stress incontinence less likely. In addition, stress incontinence would not have increased postvoid residual volume, which is more suggestive of overflow incontinence. Risk factors for stress incontinence include multiple vaginal deliveries, obesity, and prostate surgery.

Urge incontinence (Choice D), or overactive bladder with incontinence, is caused by detrusor muscle instability and commonly presents with the urge to void followed shortly by the leakage of urine. Patients would have low postvoid residual volume, in contrast with overflow incontinence such as in this patient. Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic medication used to treat urge incontinence from an overactive bladder and detrusor instability.

Urinary tract infection (Choice E) can present with an overactive bladder (frequency, urgency, urge incontinence). Patients generally also experience dysuria and suprapubic pain. The presence of bacteria and white blood cells on urinalysis is typical. This patient has no dysuria and a normal urinalysis, making urinary tract infection unlikely.

Vesicovaginal fistula (Choice F) can be a consequence of gynecologic surgery, pelvic malignancy, or radiation therapy. It typically presents with painless urinary leakage from the bladder into the vagina. On pelvic examination, a pool of urine is typically present in the vaginal canal. This patient's physical examination shows no abnormalities, making vesicovaginal fistula less likely."

",E,"No cervical cancer screening is indicated at this time given this patient's age. Pap smear testing uses a cervical swab to collect cells from the transformation zone of the cervix and is an important screening tool for the detection of cervical carcinoma. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend screening for cervical carcinoma with Pap smear testing every 3 years between ages 21 and 29 years, and Pap smear screening every 5 years with co-testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) or every 3 years with Pap smear testing alone between ages 30 and 65 years. Screening is not recommended before age 21 years. However, this patient should undergo appropriate screening for sexually transmitted infections, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, given her history of unprotected intercourse with multiple prior partners.","High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping only (Choice A) is not recommended as a screening modality for sexually transmitted infections or cervical cancer. The strains most commonly implicated in condyloma acuminata are HPV 6 and 11, whereas those that confer the highest risk for progression to cervical cancer include strains 16, 18, 31, and 33. Screening in asymptomatic patients is not recommended as infections are typically transient and may be cleared by the patient's immune system.
Pap smear and high-risk HPV genotyping (Choice B) is not recommended for this patient. Pap smear and high-risk HPV genotyping is typically reserved as a cervical cancer screening modality for patients between ages 30 and 65 years. Screening is not recommended in patients under age 21 years.
Pap smear with reflex HPV testing (Choice C) is not recommended for this patient. Clinicians may choose to perform reflex HPV testing if the result of cytology is abnormal to further delineate the risk for cervical cancer. However, neither of these tests are recommended in patients under age 21 years.
Paper smear only (Choice D) is not recommended by the USPSTF for patients under age 21 years. The risks of screening and additional testing typically outweigh the benefits in this population."

",A,"The 2023 United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend various screening tests and interventions for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Comprehensive eye examination, foot examination, major depressive disorder screening, weight management counseling, and tobacco cessation counseling are recommended annually. Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus should also be screened for high blood pressure at every medical visit. Lipid profile screening should be done at least every 5 years to measure total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations. Annual urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio test and blood test to measure serum creatinine concentration should be performed to detect early-stage kidney disease. Guidelines may need to be individualized based on a patient's specific clinical characteristics and comorbidities.","Exercise stress test (Choice B) is not appropriate for this patient. While patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus do have increased risk for cardiovascular disease, this patient shows no signs or symptoms of this. Additionally, this patient has no complaints of chest pain, nor ECG findings that would be suggestive of unstable angina or any type of occlusive coronary lesion.

Herpes zoster vaccination (Choice C) is not necessary for this patient. Herpes zoster vaccination is recommended for immunocompetent individuals over the age of 50. Given the patient's age and lack of history of HIV, cancer, or autoimmune disease, this is not yet required.

Monthly determination of hemoglobin A1c (Choice D) is not appropriate. Hemoglobin A1c is a measurement of average glycosylation of red blood cells (RBCs). Given that the average lifespan of RBCs is 90-120 days, it gives a reliable estimate of average blood glucose concentration over the preceding three months. Monthly checks are not appropriate, even in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Pneumococcal vaccination (Choice E) is not necessary for this patient. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for patients over the age of 65 or for patients who are asplenic. Given this patient's age and lack of history of splenectomy, this is incorrect."

",A,"Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a disorder of red blood cell membrane proteins that limits the ability of the cell to conform when passing through narrow capillary beds. This results in early removal of the red blood cells by the spleen and a resultant hemolysis, which causes normocytic, hemolytic anemia. HS is the most common disorder of the red blood cell membrane and is frequently seen in people of European descent. A family history of HS is generally present. Autosomal dominant mutations in ankyrin, spectrin, and band erythrocyte membrane proteins cause HS through loss of the normal connection between the inner membrane skeleton and the outer lipid bilayer. Patients typically present with fatigue, global weakness, and pallor, with associated splenomegaly and jaundice on physical examination. Laboratory studies generally show anemia and indirect hyperbilirubinemia along with an abnormal osmotic fragility test and eosin-5'-maleimide analysis on flow cytometry. Patients are prone to development of bilirubin gallstones because of the high levels of indirect bilirubin. Blood smear shows rounded red blood cells without central pallor. Splenic congestion and sequestration are hallmarks of moderate-to-severe disease. Splenectomy is indicated to reduce the degree of premature red blood cell consumption (i.e., extravascular hemolysis) and the risk for sequestration crises.","A fat-rich diet (Choice B) is not the most likely cause. While this patient does have evidence of cholelithiasis, which can then precipitate pain after fatty meals, he also has 20 gallstones which is significantly abnormal. In addition, this patient has spherocytes on blood smear and splenomegaly, neither of which can be attributed to a fat-rich diet.

Presence of antiplatelet IgG antibodies (Choice C) is seen in immune thrombocytopenia, which results from the immune-mediated destruction of circulating platelets. It presents with thrombocytopenia, mucosal bleeding, and petechiae or purpura from cutaneous hemorrhage. Platelets and erythrocytes appear normal on peripheral smear, making this answer unlikely.

Production of autoantibodies directed against the red blood cell membrane (Choice D) is seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is a type II (complement-mediated cytotoxicity) hypersensitivity reaction in which autoantibodies form to antigens on the surface of erythrocytes. Antibody binding to these antigens causes the erythrocytes to be targeted for destruction by complement, leading to the breakdown of erythrocytes (i.e., hemolysis). Hemolysis leads to the release and subsequent degradation of hemoglobin, a byproduct of which is bilirubin. Spherocytes would not be expected in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Switch from glutamic acid to valine in the globin chain (Choice E) is characteristic of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease results from a single amino acid substitution in the Œ≤-globin gene that leads to production of an abnormally shaped Œ≤-globin molecule and formation of abnormal hemoglobin S, which polymerizes abnormally in the setting of hypoxia and causes sickling of erythrocytes. Spherocytes would not be expected in a patient with sickle cell disease."

","(qid: 0288) A 16-year-old {dem-char-1} {dem-char-2} {dem-char-3} girl is brought to the office by her mother because of a 3-week history of nausea without associated vomiting. The patient's mother waits outside the examination room during the evaluation. The patient has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Since menarche at age 11 years, her menstrual periods have occurred at irregular 30- to 60-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 2 months ago. The patient reports that she has been dating her 18-year-old boyfriend for the past 5 months; they are sexually active and use condoms inconsistently. Temperature is 36.8¬∞C (98.4¬∞F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 98/62 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Urine pregnancy test is positive. While discussing the results with the patient, she states that she does not know what to do. Which of the following is the most important question for the physician to ask the patient during the conversation?
A) Do you want me to contact child protective services?
B) Have you considered placing the child up for adoption?
C) How do you think your boyfriend will react to this news?
D) Is this a situation we could discuss with your mother?

",D,"Parental consent is required for most medical care of minors (patients younger than 16 years). Exceptions include medical care related to sexual health (eg, pregnancy care, sexually transmitted infection, contraception), substance use, and life-threatening medical or psychiatric conditions. For these sensitive or time-sensitive issues, patient confidentiality and autonomy is favored over other ethical principles. This minor patient who is pregnant has challenging decisions to make. The physician's role is to discuss the options and facilitate informed and thoughtful decisions. She should be asked whether she wants her parents involved in the decision-making. If she expresses a preference to exclude her parents, the physician should honor her preference.","Do you want me to contact child protective services? (Choice A) is not a question a physician should ask a patient. As a mandated reporter, the physician is required by law to report any suspected child abuse. There is no indication that the boyfriend or parents are abusing this patient or that this patient is a danger to the fetus.

Have you considered placing the child up for adoption? (Choice B) and Would you like a confidential referral to discuss abortion services? (Choice E) are leading questions that presume that one is the best option. The decision of whether to deliver and raise a child is a personal decision. The physician should facilitate discussion of the options while abstaining from expressing an opinion.

How do you think your boyfriend will react to this news? (Choice C) strays from the physician's role of facilitating informed decision-making about management options. Though the physician may encourage the patient to discuss the decision with her loved ones (including her boyfriend) so she can think through her decision, the boyfriend's reaction is irrelevant. Additionally, this question may come off as judgmental."

",A,"Folic acid, or vitamin B9, is converted in the body to tetrahydrofolic acid and used as a coenzyme in the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleosides. Folate is contained in leafy vegetables and primarily absorbed in the jejunum. Folate deficiency is often seen in patients with malnutrition, alcohol use disorder, and patients taking anti-folate medications (e.g., phenytoin, methotrexate). Megaloblastic anemia occurs in the setting of impaired deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, commonly related to folate or vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency, and is classically characterized by erythrocyte macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils. Laboratory studies show anemia, increased mean corpuscular volume, and normal leukocyte and platelet indices. In this patient's case, the megaloblastic anemia is likely a result of folic acid deficiency, as these stores in the body can be depleted quickly in cases of malnourishment, while vitamin B12 (cobalamin) reserves are substantial and take longer to deplete.","Niacin (Choice B) results in pellagra, which classically presents with the triad of dementia, diarrhea, and dermatitis. The dermatitis is generally seen around a patient's neck in the pattern of a necklace. This patient has not had diarrhea or dermatitis.

Vitamin B1 (thiamine) (Choice C) is a cofactor for several enzymes in glucose metabolism and adenosine triphosphate production, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and Œ±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Deficiency is characterized by Wernicke encephalopathy, a triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Wernicke encephalopathy is theoretically reversible with administration of high-dose thiamine; if untreated, it can progress to Korsakoff syndrome which is characterized by dementia, confabulation, hallucinations, and psychosis.

Vitamin B6 (Choice D) deficiency is uncommon because of dietary insufficiency but when it does occur, it presents as glossitis, stomatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. It occasionally develops because of chronic therapy with isoniazid for the treatment of tuberculosis and can also result in peripheral neuropathy, but this is typically prevented by prophylactic supplementation with vitamin B6 during the antituberculosis therapy regimen.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) (Choice E) deficiency, similar to folic acid deficiency, is classically characterized by erythrocyte macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils. In addition, it also results in posterior column and spinocerebellar tract demyelination. It is most often seen in patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, pernicious anemia, or Crohn disease. However, in this patient who has only been malnourished for approximately 6 months, it is unlikely that these symptoms are because of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) depletion due to extensive storage in the body and lack of neurologic findings at present."

",D,"Alzheimer dementia is the most prevalent dementia in elderly patients and is characterized by the loss of intellectual function within multiple domains. It typically presents with progressive cognitive decline that affects a patient's ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living before progressing to affect basic activities of daily living. Examples of instrumental activities of daily living include doing laundry, housework, shopping, preparing meals, taking medications, managing money, and driving. These are more advanced skills and require higher cognitive abilities than do the basic activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and feeding. In order for elderly adults to remain independent in their homes, they must be able to perform instrumental activities of daily living. A patient's ability to perform activities of daily living can be assessed with a combination of self-reporting, caregiver reporting, and direct observation (eg, driving test, occupational therapy evaluation). In the case of potentially unsafe activities (eg, driving), the unsafe activity should be restricted until formal assessment can happen. Formal assessments can reveal the need for in-home support or a move to an assisted living facility.","The patient should be allowed to drive only with supervision (Choice A), the patient should be allowed to drive short distances only (Choice B), and the patient's driver license should be revoked (Choice E) are premature actions. No final decisions about the patient's driving abilities should be made until her abilities are formally assessed. Until this assessment, she should be restricted from driving given that her driving may be unsafe. The patient should be allowed to drive until her driving skills are formally assessed (Choice C) recognizes the need for a formal driving assessment. However, this option introduces danger to the patient and society, as the patient may be an unsafe driver. The patient should be restricted from driving until her driving safety can be assessed."

",D,"Pyloric stenosis is caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter, leading to gastric outlet obstruction and vomiting. It commonly presents with nonbloody, nonbilious emesis after feedings beginning around age 3 to 6 weeks, such as in this 4-week-old infant. It is more common in male infants. Symptoms may begin with occasional vomiting, then progress to projectile emesis after every feed, dehydration, and malnutrition as the stenosis worsens. Repeated bouts of vomiting can cause metabolic and electrolyte derangements, classically hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis due to losses of hydrochloric acid, a major component of gastric secretions. Infants can have severe electrolyte derangements that should be treated urgently. Dehydration can be shown on examination by decreased activity, listlessness, dry mucous membranes, and poor skin turgor. Pyloric stenosis on abdominal examination presents as a small, nontender mass in the epigastric region. Diagnosis of pyloric stenosis is by ultrasonography of the abdomen showing thickened pyloric musculature. Management includes correcting fluid and electrolyte abnormalities followed by surgical pyloromyotomy.","Anteroposterior and decubitus x-rays of the abdomen (Choice A) is a nonspecific study that would not necessarily show pyloric stenosis. An x-ray can help with the diagnosis of constipation and bowel obstruction but is neither sensitive nor specific. However, it would not clearly outline hypertrophy of the pylorus. It would not be as helpful as ultrasonography of the abdomen for this patient with pyloric stenosis.

Barium enema with air contrast (Choice B) is used to examine for abnormalities in the large intestines such as colon cancer. It can also be used in children to evaluate for congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung disease) and intestinal malrotation. It is not useful in the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis.

Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel (Choice C) can be helpful in the full evaluation of pyloric stenosis and repeated vomiting, which can cause metabolic and electrolyte derangements, classically hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. However, it would only be diagnostic of metabolic derangements and dehydration that can be addressed with supportive measures. Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause, pyloric stenosis, should be done using ultrasonography of the abdomen and surgical pyloromyotomy.

Observation of the infant while feeding and spitting up (Choice E) can be helpful in determining between physiologic regurgitation in infants versus projectile vomiting in pyloric stenosis. However, this patient has a 1.5-cm mass on abdominal palpation, making physiologic regurgitation less likely. Due to palpation of an abdominal mass, further evaluation for pyloric stenosis should be done using ultrasonography of the abdomen."

",D,"Routine immunizations indicated during pregnancy include the inactivated influenza virus vaccine and the tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is typically administered between weeks 27 and 36 of gestation to optimize maternal antibody response and promote placental transfer of antibodies to the fetus but can be given at any time during the pregnancy. Before infants receive their own diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine at age 2 months, maternal Tdap vaccines protect infants against neonatal tetanus and pertussis, which are associated with significant mortality. To protect infants, patients should receive the Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy (even if the pregnancies occur within the same year). Regardless of gestational age, if a pregnant patient acquires a wound and has not yet received a routine Tdap vaccine during the current pregnancy, standard wound management measures should be adopted (eg, Tdap vaccination in patients with minor wounds who have not received a Tdap vaccine within the past 10 years).","Hepatitis B (Choice A) vaccine is recommended during pregnancy for patients who have not previously completed the hepatitis B vaccine series. Because this patient's vaccine history is unknown, titers should be obtained to determine whether she has immunity to hepatitis B. If not, the vaccine should be given. Human papillomavirus (Choice B) vaccine is not typically administered during pregnancy. It has not been studied for its safety of administration during pregnancy. Because of this, it is not a part of the recommended vaccinations administered to pregnant patients. Measles-mumps-rubella (Choice C) and varicella (Choice E) vaccines should not be administered during pregnancy. There is a theoretical risk that a live attenuated vaccine may cause the infant to contract the disease (eg, congenital rubella syndrome). Because of this risk, all live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during pregnancy."

",A,"Asthma is characterized by reversible obstruction of the bronchi secondary to hyperreactivity and airway inflammation. Patients present with episodes of wheezing, dry cough, and dyspnea. On physical examination, wheezes are heard and there is sometimes a component of prolonged expiration relative to inspiration. Chest x-rays are typically normal. Pulmonary function testing may be normal between symptomatic exacerbations, but during such episodes may show an obstructive pattern with increased residual volume and total lung capacity. The severity of asthma is graded based on the frequency of day and nighttime symptomatic episodes. Intermittent asthma is characterized as symptoms occurring less than 2 days per week and less than 2 nights per month and requires as-needed, short-acting bronchodilators for symptomatic relief. Individuals with mild persistent asthma (such as this patient) exhibit symptoms at least 2 days per week or 2 nights per month, which requires the addition of daily inhaled low-dose corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone). Moderate persistent asthma is treated with the addition of inhaled long-acting Œ≤2-adrenergic agonists (eg, salmeterol) to the regimen of inhaled low-dose corticosteroids and, as needed, a short-acting bronchodilator. Severe persistent asthma is treated with the addition of high-dose corticosteroids to the regimen.","Inhaled cromolyn sodium (Choice B) is a therapy that prevents mast-cell degranulation and the release of histamine from mast cells. It can be used in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis. It is not the next step in mild persistent asthma, which is inhaled corticosteroids.

Oral leukotriene inhibitors (Choice C), such as montelukast, are used to prevent smooth muscle contraction and airway edema in asthma. However, they are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of mild persistent asthma. Thus, this patient with mild persistent asthma should be started on inhaled corticosteroids, which will be more effective in the management of her asthma.

Oral prednisone (Choice D) can be used for a short course in acute asthma exacerbations. For long-term pharmacotherapy, oral steroids are only used for patients with severe persistent asthma. This patient has mild persistent asthma, and inhaled steroids are the most appropriate next step.

No additional pharmacotherapy (Choice E) would not be appropriate for this patient with mild persistent asthma. In patients with mild persistent asthma, the addition of inhaled corticosteroids or similar appropriate controller agents is necessary. Patients with intermittent asthma may need no additional pharmacotherapy aside from short-acting bronchodilators, such as albuterol, as needed."

",D,"This patient is likely presenting with acute low back pain secondary to moving furniture in her home. Nonspecific low back pain is a very common occurrence affecting the vast majority of patients seen in primary care. When treating patients with low back pain, it is important to conduct a thorough neurologic examination to evaluate for deficits in sensation or muscle strength as well as changes to deep tendon reflexes. It is common for nonspecific low back pain to present with referred symptoms such as pain radiating into the lower extremities without findings of neurologic deficit. Most patients with acute low back pain, or pain ongoing for less than 4 weeks, will have resolution of their symptoms without further treatment. Additional laboratory studies and imaging are often not necessary in cases of acute low back pain without neurologic deficits identified on physical exam. Red-flag symptoms which would indicate emergent imaging include new fecal incontinence, urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, or rapidly progressive and significant neurologic deficits. In this case, because of the reassuring physical examination and the patient's 1-week history of symptoms, the most appropriate next step in management would be oral ibuprofen therapy.","Bed rest for 1 week (Choice A) is not an appropriate treatment for acute low back pain. Patients who undergo bed rest have been shown to experience increasingly severe pain and have a slower recovery. In this case, oral ibuprofen therapy is the most appropriate next step in management. CT scan of the lumbosacral spine (Choice B) may be a reasonable next step in management if red-flag symptoms such as new fecal incontinence, urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, or rapidly progressive and significant neurologic deficits were present on exam. Typically, MRI is the preferred emergent imaging modality, but CT scan can be used if there are contraindications to MRI. This patient does not have neurologic deficits identified on examination, making ibuprofen the most appropriate next step in management. Epidural corticosteroid injection (Choice C) may be a reasonable treatment option for patients presenting with radiculopathy. Lumbar radiculopathy often presents as pain radiating from the lumbar spine into the lower extremities with the presence of motor or sensory deficits or changes in deep tendon reflexes. This patient is presenting with referred pain into the lower extremities without neurologic changes, making ibuprofen the most appropriate next step in management. Oral prednisone therapy (Choice E) can be used in cases of acute radiculopathy. However, evidence has shown that a short prednisone taper has limited to no benefit. In this case, the patient is presenting with 1 week of low back pain with referred symptoms in the lower extremities, making ibuprofen the most appropriate next step in management."

",D,"Increased serum concentrations of lipids, including low-density cholesterol, are associated with an increased risk for coronary vascular disease. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended screening for hyperlipidemia in all men greater than age 35 years and in all women greater than age 45 years who are at an increased risk for coronary vascular disease. They also recommend initiating a statin medication in such persons age 40 to 75 years who are at an increased 10-year risk (greater than 10%) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Other risk factors for coronary vascular disease include hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, a positive family history of coronary vascular disease, and smoking. Optimization of serum lipids with pharmacologic treatment and lifestyle modification can reduce the risk for coronary vascular disease and myocardial infarction. Statins remain the first-line pharmacologic therapy for most patients with hyperlipidemia. This patient should have her serum cholesterol concentration rechecked after implementing her lifestyle modifications 1 year ago, and if it is still increased, further interventions should be initiated.","Colonoscopy (Choice A) is not currently indicated because of the patient's age. The USPSTF recommends routine colorectal cancer screening for all patients beginning at age 45 years and continuing until age 75 years. Patients with a family history of colon cancer should have their first colonoscopy screening at age 40 years or 10 years younger than the age their family member was at the time of diagnosis.

5-Hour glucose tolerance test (Choice B) may be a useful test for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, though it has been replaced by alternative screening methods and shorter protocol times of glucose tolerance. The USPSTF recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose or diabetes mellitus in patients age 35 to 70 years who are overweight or diagnosed with obesity. Currently, fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c measurements are more commonly used than glucose tolerance testing for initial screening. This patient should be screened for diabetes as well; however, she should receive a standard screening method. The 5-hour glucose tolerance test is not considered standard.

Mammography (Choice C) is not indicated in this patient at this time. The USPSTF recommends a screening mammogram every 1 to 2 years for patients over age 50 years with individualized decisions beginning at age 40 years. These recommendations, as of 2023, are currently being updated.

Pap smear (Choice E) is not indicated at this time since the patient had one a year ago. The USPSTF recommends a pap smear every 3 years in patients age 21 to 65 years or every 5 years in patients who have a normal pap smear in addition to a negative human papillomavirus test."

She has no other history of serious illness and takes no medications. Since admission, she has received nebulized albuterol and oral prednisone. She is alert, has no difficulty speaking, and reports no shortness of breath. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 2 Umin of oxygen by nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. She is not using accessory muscles of respiration. There are mild, scattered wheezes on expiration. Upon discharge, the patient is switched from nebulized albuterol. In addition to completing the course of prednisone begun in the hospital, which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy?
A) Inhaled cromolyn
B) Inhaled fluticasone
C) Inhaled salmeterol
D) Oral cetirizine
E) Oral montelukast
",B,"This patient is transitioning from the acute management of asthma exacerbation to outpatient therapy. Patients should be prescribed an inhaled bronchodilator (typically a shortacting inhaled J3-adrenergic agonist [SABA] such as albuterol) as needed for symptom management and a longer-acting controller medication to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms. Most guidelines recommend use of a stepwise approach for selecting treatment based on asthma severity. The severity of asthma is determined by assessing the current degree of symptom frequency and functional impairment and is typically categorized as intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent. This patient's daily symptoms and night awakenings are considered moderate persistent asthma, and a controller medication is recommended. For moderate persistent asthma, preferred therapy consists of a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) such as fluticasone or a combination ICS and long-acting J3-adrenergic agonist (LABA), such as inhaled salmeterol. ICS is the most effective controller medication, so it is included in all regimens for managing persistent asthma. Inhaled fluticasone would be the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to add at this point.","Inhaled cromolyn (Choice A) is less effective than inhaled corticosteroids. It is considered a second-line therapy for exercise-induced bronchospasm.

Inhaled salmeterol (Choice C) is a long-acting J3-adrenergic agonist that is utilized in combination with ICS for the treatment of moderate persistent asthma. Prior to initiating a LABA, such as salmeterol, the patient must first be given an ICS. If the patient experiences persistent symptoms with an ICS, then a LABA should be considered.

Oral cetirizine (Choice D) may be effective in the management of allergic rhinitis but is not routinely used for the treatment of asthma. Histamine plays a lesser role in non-allergic asthma variants.

Oral montelukast (Choice E), and other leukotriene receptor antagonists, are effective in controlling mild to moderate asthma symptoms as monotherapy and are commonly used as alternatives to first-line regimens. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred initial therapy because they are generally favored in clinical efficacy comparisons."
