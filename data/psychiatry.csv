",C,"A disproportionate fear of serious disease is consistent with illness anxiety disorder. According to the DSM-5, patients with illness anxiety disorder demonstrate excessive anxiety and preoccupation about the possibility that they may have or acquire a serious illness such that they perform frequent health-related behaviors (eg, repeatedly going to the doctor) or exhibit maladaptive avoidance (eg, completely avoiding going to the doctor). This preoccupation persists for at least 6 months. Management centers around regular primary care follow-up evaluation that targets coping skills, provides reassurance, and avoids unnecessary tests.","Body dysmorphic disorder (Choice A) manifests as preoccupation with a perceived flaw in physical appearance leading to repetitive behaviors (eg, checking) or mental acts (eg, comparing appearance to others). This patient is less concerned about her appearance than the possibility that she has a serious illness.

Generalized anxiety disorder (Choice B) is an anxiety disorder that features excessive worrying about a range of topics with psychological and physical symptoms and associated functional impairment. This patient's worry is specific to the possibility of having a serious illness.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (Choice D) is an anxiety disorder typically characterized by obsessions (unwanted, intrusive thoughts that produce anxiety) that the patient attempts to neutralize with compulsions (repetitive behaviors). Compulsions are typically ego-dystonic (recognizable by the patient as abnormal or excessive), whereas this patient's mole-checking behavior is ego-syntonic (she does not view the checking as problematic). As well, this patient's anxiety-driven behaviors logically stem from her concern about having melanoma, whereas there is commonly less of a logical link between obsessions and compulsions in obsessive-compulsive disorder.

In somatic symptom disorder (Choice E), the patient is preoccupied with existing somatic symptoms such that these symptoms disrupt the patient's daily life.
Patients with somatic symptom disorder persistently devote excessive time and energy to these symptoms or related health concerns (eg, repeatedly going to the doctor). Patients with illness anxiety disorder typically have milder somatic symptoms relative to their concern about developing a serious illness."

",B,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is commonly acquired secondary to electrolyte disturbance or medications (eg, chronic lithium use) that render the renal collecting duct insensitive to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Normally, ADH triggers the insertion of aquaporin channels into the collecting duct membrane via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated pathway. Over time, lithium concentrates within the cells of the collecting duct and interferes with this signaling pathway, leading to limited aquaporin insertion and compromised ability of the kidney to reclaim free water. Dehydration results, as found in this patient, along with symptoms of polydipsia (compensatory response to low serum volume or increased serum osmolarity) and polyuria or incontinence (due to the large volume of dilute urine produced). In severe cases of dehydration, vital signs may show tachycardia and hypotension. Physical examination is generally unremarkable, apart from potential signs of volume depletion (eg, weak pulse, skin tenting, altered mental status). Laboratory studies show increased serum osmolarity, hypernatremia, and inappropriately dilute urine. Normally, urine should be concentrated in states of hyperosmolar serum, as the main physiologic function of ADH is to reclaim water, thereby maintaining serum osmolarity and sodium balance in addition to plasma volume. Desmopressin, an ADH analog, is used as a means of differentiating nephrogenic from central diabetes insipidus. Central diabetes insipidus occurs due to an absence of ADH production, not a failure of the renal collecting tubule to respond to it. If urine output and serum osmolarity decrease following desmopressin administration, a central cause of diabetes insipidus (eg, head trauma, hypothalamic damage, pituitary tumor) should be investigated. No change in response to desmopressin indicates that the cause of diabetes insipidus is nephrogenic. The treatment of NDI may include volume repletion plus thiazide diuretics.","Acute lithium toxicity (Choice A) is characterized by neurologic (eg, somnolence, confusion, ataxia, nystagmus, coarse tremors, seizures), gastrointestinal, and cardiac manifestations (eg, bradycardia). Because lithium is similar in charge and size to sodium and exclusively metabolized by the kidney, conditions that increase renal reabsorption of sodium or decrease renal function can increase serum lithium concentrations and the risk for lithium toxicity. Causes include the use of thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ACE inhibitors, and hypovolemia.

Lithium-induced hypothyroidism (Choice C) occurs in as many as 50% of patients being treated with lithium, usually within 1 to 2 years of beginning treatment. Hyperthyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis may also occur. While this patient's TSH is mildly increased, hypernatremia, polyuria, and inappropriately dilute urine are characteristic of NDI, not hypothyroidism.

Routine side effects due to lithium treatment (Choice D) include tremor, nystagmus, polyuria, and mild thyroid dysfunction. While this patient does have polyuria, her dehydration, altered mental status, hypernatremia, and inappropriately dilute urine are concerning for a potentially life-threatening condition and should not be dismissed as routine.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Choice E) often presents with polyuria due to increased amounts of glucose in the proximal convoluted tubule, which causes osmotic diuresis. While this patient does have polyuria, hypernatremia and a history of chronic lithium use are more consistent with NDI."

",D,"Alcohol use disorder refers to an addiction to alcohol that must meet at least two criteria, including an inability to cut back on drinking, drinking more than expected, excessive time spent drinking, alcohol cravings, persistent drinking despite physical or mental problems related to drinking, or persistent drinking despite negative social consequences. Though patients with mild alcohol use disorder may rely solely on psychosocial supports such as 12-step programs, patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder or patients unable to access or tolerate psychosocial supports may benefit from daily medication. Commonly used medications for alcohol use disorder include naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, and gabapentin. Naltrexone, a long-acting opioid receptor antagonist, blocks the rewarding effects of drinking alcohol and thinking about alcohol, thereby preventing alcohol cravings. Naltrexone can be used in conjunction with alcohol and is therefore helpful for patients (like this patient) interested in moderating their drinking but unsure whether they want to quit.","Amitriptyline (Choice A) and sertraline (Choice E) are antidepressants used in major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. They are not helpful in alcohol use disorder. Clonazepam (Choice B) is a benzodiazepine medication used to treat anxiety. Though other benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide) are commonly used in alcohol withdrawal, this patient has not yet committed to quitting alcohol, so a medication to help him is more appropriate. Disulfiram (Choice C) inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, causing acetaldehyde accumulation, which leads to unpleasant physical effects, including headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and hypotension. It is helpful in patients who are motivated to stay sober from alcohol but not patients who are unsure about completely discontinuing their alcohol use."

",B,"This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for brief psychotic disorder. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the acute onset of one or more psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior) lasting less than 1 month. This patient was experiencing paranoid delusions. Risk factors for brief psychotic disorder include stressful life events and personality disorders. Treatment may include hospitalization and antipsychotic treatment depending on symptom severity and functional impairment, though some symptoms or the entire presentation may resolve without medications.","Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (Choice A) refers to the onset of disproportionate distress within 3 months of an identifiable stressor with associated anxiety, depression, and conduct disturbances. Psychotic symptoms would be atypical. Delusional disorder (Choice C) is a psychotic disorder that features the presence of one or more delusions for 1 month or longer with no other psychotic symptoms. This patient's psychotic symptoms lasted 1 week only. Post-traumatic stress disorder (Choice D) refers to symptoms of intrusive thoughts/memories of trauma, hyperarousal, avoidance of trauma reminders, and/or negative mood/thoughts resulting from a traumatic event such as a life-threatening motor vehicle collision and lasting more than 1 month. This patient did not experience a life-threatening incident, intrusive memories, avoidance of trauma reminders, or negative changes in mood. Patients with schizophreniform disorder (Choice E) must demonstrate two of the following: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or disorganized behavior (known as positive symptoms), or negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, apathy, alogia). To meet diagnostic criteria, patients must demonstrate symptoms for more than 1 month and less than 6 months. This patient does not meet the duration criteria for schizophreniform disorder. Substance-induced psychotic disorder (Choice F) refers to psychotic symptoms secondary to substance use. Alcohol use rarely leads directly to psychotic symptoms. Though heavy cannabis use can lead to psychotic symptoms, this patient's cannabis use is intermittent."

E) Transition the patient to comfort care only
",C,"Patients who are making high-stakes or risky medical decisions (eg, declining a life-saving procedure) should be informally or formally evaluated for decision-making capacity. This patient demonstrates abnormalities on cognitive testing and has risk factors for cognitive impairment, including traumatic brain injury and prior illicit drug use. Cognitive impairment confers a higher risk for a lack of decision-making capacity. To meet the criteria for decision-making capacity, patients must express a consistent choice, demonstrate an understanding of the risks and benefits of the choice, demonstrate an appreciation of the significance of the choice for their personal circumstances, and illustrate an ability to reason through the options. The medical team should assess the patient's decision-making capacity for each decision at each point in time. If decision-making capacity is present, the medical team should respect the patient's choice. If decision-making capacity is absent, the medical team should first try to restore decision-making capacity (eg, treat psychosis). If decision-making capacity cannot be restored, then the medical team needs to rely on substituted judgment from durable powers of attorney or next of kin.","Contact the hospital ethics committee for a clinical decision (Choice A) is unnecessary at this point. The medical team should first assess the patient's decision-making capacity. If decision-making capacity is absent and the patient has no durable power of attorney or next of kin, then the hospital ethics committee should be contacted. Defer the decision to prison authorities (Choice B) is unethical. Prison authorities, involved in the patient's punishment, should play no role in medical decision making. Obtain complete neurocognitive testing (Choice D) may be helpful in elucidating the reason for the patient's abnormalities on cognitive screening. However, the most urgent issue is determining the patient's decision-making capacity to decline the aortic valve replacement procedure. Transition the patient to comfort care only (Choice E) is premature. The medical team should first assess the patient's decision-making capacity to decline the aortic valve replacement procedure."

",C,"Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine with a short half-life, can lead to rebound anxiety, resulting in this patient's increased lorazepam use. Also, lorazepam commonly leads to delirium in older patients. Thus, lorazepam should be discontinued. This patient who reports a sad mood, insomnia, decreased appetite, decreased energy, and decreased motivation/activity likely meets criteria for major depressive disorder (MOD). MOD is characterized by 2 or more weeks of at least five of the following symptoms: depressed mood, anhedonia, guilt or worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, psychomotor slowing, suicidal thoughts, and/or neurovegetative symptoms (decreased energy, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance). These symptoms disrupt everyday functioning. Patients commonly have negative thoughts about themselves, others, and the world. Patients seeing themselves as a burden also constitutes an acute risk factor for suicide. Older men are at particularly high risk for completing suicide, so this patient should be carefully evaluated for suicidal ideation. Many depressed patients engage in anxious rumination. MOD that includes anxiety symptoms can be termed ""MOD with anxious features"" per the DSM-5. Initial antidepressant medication for most patients is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy. However, for patients with the combination of decreased appetite and insomnia, mirtazapine is another reasonable first-line option given its adverse effect profile that includes weight gain and sedation. Mirtazapine, an atypical antidepressant medication, is a selective a2-receptor antagonist and serotonin modulator.","Continue current regimen for 3 weeks and reassure the patient (Choice A) would be inappropriate given that lorazepam has been ineffective for the patient's anxiety and carries a delirium risk for older patients. As well, the patient demonstrates depressive symptoms that are unlikely to respond to lorazepam only. Continue lorazepam and add amitriptyline (Choice B) would be inappropriate given that lorazepam has been ineffective for the patient's anxiety and carries a delirium risk for older patients. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. Tricyclic antidepressants are not first-line options for MOD given their anticholinergic adverse effects and cardiac and seizure risks. The anticholinergic adverse effects are associated with delirium in older patients. Discontinue lorazepam and reevaluate after 1 week (Choice D) is a less optimal option than discontinuing lorazepam and starting mirtazapine. This patient has depressive symptoms that should be addressed with antidepressant medication. Increase the dosage of lorazepam to 2 mg as necessary (Choice E) is unlikely to be helpful and is likely to worsen the patient's rebound anxiety and delirium risk."

",C,"A decreased serum C-peptide concentration indicates that exogenous insulin is being administered, consistent with a diagnosis of factitious disorder. The pancreas coproduces insulin and C-peptide. Measurement of serum C-peptide concentration can be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus and distinguish type 1 from type 2. It can also be used in diagnosing factitious hypoglycemia when a patient may be suspected of self-administering insulin. Though serum insulin concentration will appear increased (and blood glucose will consequently be decreased), negative feedback on the pancreas decreases production of C-peptide (and native insulin). In factitious disorder, patients consciously produce symptoms (eg, purposely injure themselves, fake a fever by eating something warm) for primary gain. Primary gain is the motivation to be cared for, which constitutes an unconscious motivator for the patient's conscious production of symptoms. Early losses, neglect, or abuse may disrupt patients' identity and relationships, and adopting the sick role may represent patients' attempts to cope with stress and stabilize their identity and relationships. Psychiatric comorbidities (eg, depression, substance use disorders, personality disorders) are common but not present in all patients. Diagnosis is supported by inconsistencies in the history or physical examination and a history of extensive clinical evaluations. Treatment includes regular follow-up visits with one physician who oversees management (as opposed to symptom-triggered appointments) and possible psychotherapy.","Autoimmune hypothyroidism (Choice A) is associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction has been associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance syndrome (Choice E) describes sequelae of insulin resistance including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (Choice G) involves the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in decreased insulin and C-peptide concentrations. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Choice H) involves insulin resistance, which drives increased serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations. All these conditions are more likely to present with hyperglycemia than hypoglycemia. In diabetes insipidus (Choice B), a lack of antidiuretic hormone (central) or resistance to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic) leads to decreased free water reabsorption from collecting tubules, resulting in polyuria along with a state of dehydration and hypernatremia. Diabetes insipidus does not directly influence blood glucose or serum C-peptide concentrations. Primary hyperparathyroidism (Choice D) results in hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, subperiosteal bone resorption, and renal failure. Over time, primary hyperparathyroidism can lead to insulin resistance. However, insulin resistance most commonly presents with hyperglycemia and increased serum C-peptide and insulin concentrations. Insulinoma (Choice F) refers to a rare neoplasm of pancreatic islet cells that functionally produces insulin. These neoplastic cells classically do not respond to typical feedback mechanisms, and, as a result, insulin is continuously produced even in periods of hypoglycemia. Patients present with symptoms of hypoglycemia; however, serum C-peptide concentration would be increased."

",D,"This patient likely has vaginismus, involuntary muscle spasm during vaginal penetration. Patients are defined in the DSM-5 as having difficulty with vaginal intercourse, genito-pelvic pain, fear of vaginal penetration or pain, and increased pelvic floor muscle tension during attempted penetration. Risk factors include a history of abuse, anxiety disorders, relationship conflicts, and cultural taboos (though not all patients have these risk factors). Vaginismus can also happen secondary to vulval infections (eg, candidiasis), gynecological problems (eg, endometriosis), or pregnancy. Physical examination is typically normal other than pelvic floor muscle tightness. Treatment is multimodal and commonly involves pelvic floor physical therapy, psychotherapy (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy), psychoeducation, and/or topical pain medication.","Generalized anxiety disorder (Choice A) is characterized by 6 months or more of excessive worrying about a range of topics and is associated with three additional psychological symptoms (irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, fatigability, sleep disturbance) and/or muscle tension. This patient's anxiety is specific to vaginal penetration.

In somatic symptom disorder (Choice B), the patient is excessively and persistently preoccupied with one or more somatic symptoms such that these symptoms disrupt the patient's daily life. Patients typically devote excessive time and energy to these symptoms or related health concerns (eg, repeatedly going to the doctor). This patient does not demonstrate excessive health-seeking behaviors or preoccupation other than when she is attempting vaginal penetration.

Vaginal candidiasis (Choice C) is associated with vaginismus. However, pelvic examination typically shows vulvar and vaginal erythema and edema and thick white discharge. As well, this patient lacks risk factors for vaginal candidiasis (eg, antibiotic use, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressed status).

Vulvodynia (Choice E) refers to vulvar pain (or burning or stinging) of unknown etiology, not vaginal pain. This pain is not typically provoked by vaginal penetration."

",D,"Phencyclidine, also known as PCP, is an NMDA glutamatergic receptor antagonist that is used recreationally for its euphoria-inducing and dissociative effects. PCP intoxication is often characterized by signs and symptoms including hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, erratic behavior, paranoia, psychosis, aggression, decreased sensation, ataxia, nystagmus, myoclonus, and dysarthria. Patients may require sedation, treatment with antipsychotic medications, or physical restraint until their symptoms subside. Withdrawal symptoms following PCP intoxication are uncommon. Naloxone has no effect on the pathways involved in PCP intoxication.","Alcohol intoxication (Choice A) presents with sedation, altered mentation, dysarthria, and vomiting. Alcohol withdrawal may lead to severe complications including delirium tremens and seizures. Alcohol intoxication does not typically present with nystagmus; hyperthermia and autonomic instability would also be uncommon in acute intoxication, though the vasodepressive and sedating effects can result in hypotension and bradypnea. Amphetamine intoxication (Choice B) may resemble PCP intoxication and also presents with hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, erratic behavior, and paranoid or delusional thinking. However, it does not typically present with nystagmus, ataxia, or myoclonus. Opioid intoxication (Choice C) may result in erratic behavior, miosis, respiratory depression, and obtundation but should respond rapidly to administration of naloxone. Failure of respiratory depression and mental status to improve following naloxone administration should lead to consideration of alternative diagnoses. Schizophrenia (Choice E) presents with hallucinations and delusional, disorganized thinking and behavior. Schizophrenia symptoms are typically chronic. Nystagmus, ataxia, and myoclonus are not typical of schizophrenia."

",B,"This patient is experiencing an episode of acute mania and can therefore be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that features acute episodes of mania and may include episodes of depression.Acute mania typically manifests with an irritable or euphoric mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, rapid speech and thinking, irresponsibility (as evidenced by this patient's sexual advances and overspending), and grandiose thinking. Some patients demonstrate associated psychotic symptoms (eg, grandiose delusions as in this patient, hallucinations). Acute mania can severely disrupt patients' daily function and endanger their safety. Management of acute mania typically requires mood stabilizing therapy (eg, mood stabilizers or mood stabilizing atypical antipsychotics).","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Choice A) presents with chronic symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity and/or inattention that occur in more than one setting and impair academic, social, and/or emotional function. This patient instead presents with acutely hyperactive and impulsive behavior along with several other symptoms consistent with acute mania.
Delusional disorder (Choice C) presents with fixed delusions in the absence of other psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, disorganization, depression, or mania.
Histrionic personality disorder (Choice D), a cluster B personality disorder, is characterized by theatrical, superficial expressions of emotion that unconsciously serve to garner attention from others to fulfill emotional needs. Personality disorder symptoms are chronic and pervasive, whereas this patient's seductive behavior is occurring in the setting of acute manic symptoms.
Schizophrenia (Choice E) presents with at least two of the following five symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, or negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, apathy, alogia). This patient does not demonstrate negative symptoms, instead presenting with acute manic symptoms consistent with bipolar disorder."

",C,"Delirium is an acute confusional state typically resulting from acute medical illness, sleep disturbances, substance use, and/or medications. Delirium is especially likely in older patients who possess a decreased cognitive reserve, though it is also likely in younger patients with acute medical illness (as in this patient with a high fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain who may have a serious infection such as acute cholecystitis or cholangitis). Delirium presents with acute disturbances in awareness, attention, and baseline cognition that fluctuate in severity during the course of the day. Patients may present with perceptual disturbances (eg, hallucinations, delusions). Management of delirium should focus on treatment of the underlying medical condition if one is detected, frequent reorientation, maintenance of normal sleep-wake cycles, and placement of the patient in a calm and soothing environment.","Alcohol withdrawal (Choice A) can present with acute confusion in the case of delirium tremens. Delirium tremens typically presents with autonomic instability (eg, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, hyperthermia), tremors, anxiety, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, and ataxia, and may result in convulsions, coma, and death. However, this patient's moderate use of alcohol is unlikely to lead to a severe withdrawal syndrome including delirium tremens. As well, the patient has the localizing symptom of abdominal pain; in addition to his fever, this symptom suggests an acute abdominal infection (alcoholic hepatitis is less likely given his moderate use of alcohol).

Cerebral infarction (Choice B) is unlikely in this young, relatively healthy patient. As well, his fever and abdominal pain are inconsistent with cerebral infarction.

Porphyria (Choice D) is a group of disorders of heme synthesis characterized by accumulation of heme precursors and may present with dark-colored urine, gastrointestinal distress, and blistering of the skin. This patient does not have blistering skin.

Patients with schizophreniform disorder (Choice E) must demonstrate two of following: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or disorganized behavior (known as positive symptoms), or negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, apathy, alogia). Patients with schizophreniform disorder do not typically present with acute fluctuations in awareness, attention, and cognitive symptoms such as orientation."

",A,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder that presents with chronic symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity and/or inattention that occur in more than one setting and impair academic, social, and/or emotional function. Children with predominant hyperactivity symptoms are unable to sit still and may have difficulty with impulse control (postulated to result from a dysregulated dopamine reward pathway), resulting in movement initiation without planning and consequent injuries, as in this patient. Some patients with ADHD may demonstrate body-focused activities (eg, nose picking, skin picking) to relieve their inner sense of restlessness. Children with predominant inattentive symptoms tend to daydream, process information slowly, and have difficulty completing tasks (related to norepinephrine dysregulation). This patient demonstrates predominant hyperactive symptoms. For diagnosis, physicians must establish that the patient is functionally impaired in several settings, so parents and teachers must fill out behavioral rating scales. Stimulants, which include amphetamine salts and methylphenidate, are first-line agents for treatment that increase synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine. Sleep problems, including comorbid primary sleep disorders (eg, insomnia) and stimulant-induced sleep problems, are common in patients with ADHD.","Allergy skin tests (Choice B) help assess whether a particular substance is causing a patient's atopic and/or allergic symptomatology. Clotting factor tests (Choice C) help assess for bleeding disorders. This patient's ecchymosis is more likely due to impulse dysregulation in the setting of ADHD. X-rays of the long bones for fractures (Choice D) help assess for a history of child abuse. This patient has symptoms of ADHD, which can explain his history of frequent injuries.

Persecutory delusions (as in this patient) and somatic delusions are common types of delusions. Many patients will only present for care at the insistence of other people given their lack of insight into the psychotic nature of their concern. Treatment typically includes antipsychotic medication and psychotherapy with the goal of improving the patient's coping with the delusion and gradually increasing insight into the delusion. The prognosis is guarded.","Bipolar disorder (Choice A) is characterized by discrete episodes of depression and mania, which can sometimes be accompanied by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. This patient does not report mood symptoms (eg, depressed or euphoric mood, increased or decreased sleep).
Borderline personality disorder (Choice B) is a cluster B personality disorder, the emotional or dramatic cluster, that features emotional dysregulation, an unstable sense of self, and tumultuous relationships. When stressed, patients with borderline personality disorder can demonstrate paranoid thinking. However, this patient's delusion has persisted independent of her mental state, which is more consistent with delusional disorder.
Paranoid personality disorder (Choice D) is a cluster A personality disorder, the odd or eccentric cluster, characterized by a pervasive mistrust of others and viewing others as possessing malicious intent. Personality disorders typically begin in young adulthood. This patient's psychotic symptoms developed in middle age, which is inconsistent with a personality disorder.

",A,"Increased serotonin likely explains this patient's sexual dysfunction. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that increases synaptic serotonin activity and improves mood in patients with major depressive disorder. SSRIs commonly cause sexual dysfunction within all three phases of sexual response (libido, sexual arousal, and orgasm). If a patient's decreased libido is persistent and distressing, initial management commonly involves decreasing the SSRI dose, especially if depression has been in sustained remission. If this is ineffective, then the physician can consider discontinuing fluoxetine since this patient's depression has been in sustained remission, and she has only experienced one depressive episode. If the patient prefers to stay on antidepressant medication to prevent future depressive episodes, then adding bupropion or switching to an antidepressant with a lower risk for sexual dysfunction (eg, bupropion, mirtazapine) would be reasonable options.","Initiating propranolol (Choice B) is unlikely to help sexual dysfunction. As well, propranolol is not helpful for major depressive disorder.
Initiating sildenafil (Choice C) is unlikely to be helpful. Sildenafil can be helpful in treating antidepressant-induced arousal problems and anorgasmia but has not been shown to affect libido.
Recommending weekend drug holidays (Choice D) is not a commonly used strategy for addressing sexual dysfunction and would interfere with the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine.
Replacing fluoxetine with citalopram (Choice E) is unlikely to resolve this patient's SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, as citalopram carries a similar risk for sexual dysfunction compared with fluoxetine."

",D,"Panic attacks feature acute fear or anxiety that peaks within minutes and is associated with four additional physical symptoms of sympathetic hyperarousal or associated mental states. These additional symptoms may include heart palpitations or tachycardia, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, the sensation of choking, gastrointestinal distress, paresthesia, sweating, chills, trembling, derealization, the fear of dying, and/or the fear of losing control. Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent panic attacks that are unexpected and associated with worry about future panic attacks or avoidance of panic attack triggers. The pathogenesis involves genetic factors, an anxious temperament, and stressful life events leading to catastrophic appraisals of internal body states such as normal sympathetic activity. Lactate infusions recreate a state of bodily stress. It has been found that patients with panic disorder experience panic attacks in response to lactate at an increased rate compared with the general population. However, there is an absence of standardized criteria for lactate-induced panic attacks, so the diagnostic utility of this test is unclear. Treatment of panic disorder typically includes antidepressant medication and/or cognitive behavioral therapy with a focus on decreasing patients' catastrophic appraisal of bodily sensations of sympathetic hyperarousal and increasing patients' ability to cope with panic attack sensations.","Abnormal eye tracking (Choice A) is found in patients with schizophrenia. Patients with panic disorder do not demonstrate abnormal eye tracking.

Delayed REM sleep on polysomnography (Choice B) can be found in sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder. Certain medications such as tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, amphetamine, and barbiturates as well as alcohol also delay the REM sleep phase. No known association exists between delayed REM sleep and panic disorder.

Enlarged third and lateral ventricles on CT scan of the head (Choice C) occurs as a result of stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius (cerebral aqueduct), the most common cause of congenital hydrocephalus. This would be atypical in a previously healthy young adult and would not explain her array of symptoms.

Nonsuppression of cortisol after administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (Choice E) is consistent with Cushing syndrome, not panic disorder."

",E,"In typical REM sleep, several neural circuits terminate on spinal cord motor neurons to cause sleep atonia. This muscle atonia is lost in REM sleep behavior disorder, in which patients typically violently act out their dreams. They typically, but not always, remember the dreams. REM sleep behavior disorder most commonly occurs in adult males and can be idiopathic or related to underlying a-synuclein deposition (eg, Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, or Lewy body dementia). Polysomnography showing absent atonia during REM sleep confirms the diagnosis. Treatment includes creating a safe sleep environment and, if the behavior is severe, initiating melatonin or clonazepam. Patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder should be closely monitored due to the high rate of developing a neurodegenerative disease.","Antisocial personality disorder (Choice A), a cluster B personality disorder, the emotional or dramatic cluster, is characterized by a pervasive violation of others' rights, aggression, and a hostile and manipulative attitude toward others. This patient is in REM sleep during these episodes and is therefore not demonstrating a conscious violation of others' rights or a manipulative attitude. Complex partial seizures (Choice B) are characterized by repetitive movements during sleep with minimal memory of the event. This patient demonstrates coordinated sequences of movements rather than repetitive movements. Nightmare disorder (Choice C) describes the presence of recurrent disturbing dreams. This patient makes no report of disturbing dream activity though such can be inferred from his behavior. While his dreams may be nightmares, the absence of sleep atonia makes REM sleep behavior disorder more likely. Nocturnal panic attacks (Choice D) occur during the night and wake up the patient. This patient is still asleep while acting out his dreams."

",A,"Oppositional defiant disorder is a childhood disruptive behavior disorder that manifests as a persistent pattern of angry/irritable mood, defiant behavior (eg, arguing with or defying authority figures, blaming others for their own mistakes), and vindictiveness. These behaviors cause dysfunction in the patient's immediate social context (most commonly with family members) or lead to educational or occupational dysfunction. This patient demonstrates defiant behavior toward his parents, teachers, and the physician. Oppositional defiant disorder commonly arises from a combination of genetic factors, an irritable temperament, and, sometimes, childhood neglect or a harsh parenting style. Comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are common. Management is multimodal and includes parent management training (teaching parents to reinforce positive and punish negative behaviors), school-based interventions, and individual anger management therapy.",Insight-oriented psychotherapy (Choice B) and psychoanalytic psychotherapy (Choice C) both attempt to uncover unconscious thoughts and feelings that drive present-day behaviors and relationships.

",E,"This patient demonstrates premature ejaculation, a type of sexual dysfunction. Psychological factors such as performance anxiety, marital conflict, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, as in this patient) can exert a strong influence on sexual function. In males, anxiety can lead to decreased libido, decreased ability to obtain or maintain an erection, premature ejaculation, or decreased ability to ejaculate. Treatment strategies for sexual dysfunction include cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation training, or pharmacotherapy. First-line pharmacotherapy for premature ejaculation is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy, particularly paroxetine. SSRIs have an unclear mechanism for delaying ejaculation that likely involves descending serotonin pathways. Patients with PTSD experience intrusive thoughts/memories (eg, nightmares, flashbacks), dysregulation of arousal (eg, irritability, angry outbursts, restlessness, easy startle), avoidance of reminders (eg, staying in the home), and negative mood/thoughts (eg, psychomotor retardation, feelings of detachment). SSRIs are also a first-line treatment for PTSD.","Bupropion (Choice A) is an antidepressant that increases synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine. Bupropion has a small amount of evidence for the treatment of premature ejaculation, but SSRIs have more evidence for their effectiveness. As well, bupropion has no proven efficacy for PTSD. Buspirone (Choice B) is a serotonin modulator useful for generalized anxiety disorder. It has no use for premature ejaculation. Lorazepam (Choice C) is a short-acting benzodiazepine. It has been found to worsen PTSD outcomes, likely by promoting avoidance of trauma-related emotions and thus preventing habituation of these emotions. Mirtazapine (Choice D), an atypical antidepressant medication, is a selective alpha-2 receptor antagonist and serotonin modulator. It has not proven efficacious for premature ejaculation."

",A,"This patient is experiencing an episode of acute mania and can therefore be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that features acute episodes of mania and may include episodes of depression. Acute mania typically manifests with an irritable or euphoric mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, rapid speech and thinking, irresponsibility, and grandiose thinking. Some patients demonstrate associated psychotic symptoms (eg, grandiose delusions as in this patient, hallucinations). Acute mania can severely disrupt patients' daily function and endanger their safety, as in this patient. Management of acute mania typically requires mood stabilizing therapy (eg, mood stabilizers or mood stabilizing atypical antipsychotics).","Brief psychotic disorder (Choice B) is characterized by at least one acute psychotic symptom (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior) lasting less than 1 month. This patient's psychotic symptoms appear to be secondary to mania.
Delirium, alcohol withdrawal (Choice C), or delirium tremens, refers to an alcohol withdrawal that typically presents with autonomic instability (eg, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, hyperthermia), tremors, anxiety, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, and ataxia, and may result in convulsions, coma, and death. This patient has normal vital signs and is fully oriented.
Delusional disorder (Choice D) presents with fixed delusions in the absence of other psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations, disorganization, depression, or mania.
Malingering (Choice E) refers to consciously producing or falsifying symptoms for a conscious purpose such as obtaining disability payments or release from jail. It is unlikely that someone would volitionally walk outside in the cold to the point of inducing frostbite for secondary gain. As well, this patient has no clear source of secondary gain.
Schizoid personality disorder (Choice F), a cluster A personality disorder, manifests as extreme social detachment and a cold, restricted affect. These patients typically disengage from society. This patient is playful and talkative.
Schizophrenia (Choice G) presents with at least two of the following five symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, or negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, apathy, alogia). This patient does not demonstrate negative symptoms, instead presenting with acute manic symptoms consistent with bipolar disorder."

",A,"Acute stress disorder (ASD) presents similarly to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with intrusive thoughts/memories (eg, nightmares, flashbacks), dysregulation of arousal (eg, nervousness, insomnia, easy startle, decreased concentration), avoidance of reminders, and negative mood/thoughts (eg, psychomotor retardation,feelings of detachment) in response to violence or threatened violence. Like in PTSD, patients can also experience dissociation, the mind's attempt to decrease conscious awareness of painful affects by decreasing its awareness of reality (as in this patient's depersonalization and derealization). However, ASD presents within 1 month of a traumatic event, whereas PTSD lasts more than 1 month beyond the event. ASD typically lasts between 3 days to 1 month. Pharmacotherapy is typically not indicated, but trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful. In this case, providing normalization about the range of reactions to trauma and education about when to seek psychiatric help will be most helpful.","Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (Choice B) refers to the onset of disproportionate distress, with associated anxiety and depressive symptoms, within 3 months of an identifiable stressor. Intrusive thoughts/memories and arousal dysregulation are specific to ASD/PTSD.

Brief psychotic disorder (Choice C) is characterized by at least one acute psychotic symptom (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior) lasting less than 1 month. This patient is experiencing trauma-induced dissociation, not psychotic symptoms.

Depersonalization disorder (Choice D) is a type of dissociative disorder involving detachment from the self. The detachment must cause clinically significant distress or dysfunction. This patient's depersonalization does not clearly cause daily dysfunction and can be conceptualized as part of ASD given her other trauma-related symptoms.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (Choice E) refers to symptoms of intrusive thoughts/memories of trauma, hyperarousal, avoidance of trauma reminders, and/or negative mood/thoughts resulting from a traumatic event such as a life-threatening motor vehicle collision and lasting more than 1 month.

Amphetamines are central nervous system stimulants that cause euphoria and increase sympathetic tone due to increased catecholamine concentration, leading to tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, pupillary dilation, diaphoresis, agitation, and restlessness. Appetite suppression and weight loss are common. Patients with chronic methamphetamine use disorder often have periodontal disease such as stained teeth, cavities, or missing teeth. Chronic methamphetamine use can also lead to methamphetamine-induced psychotic disorder, which features chronic delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations. Tactile or visual hallucinations of parasitosis may occur.","Alcohol intoxication (Choice A) can cause slurred speech, emotional instability, behavioral disinhibition, ataxia, and memory lapses (like benzodiazepine intoxication). In severe intoxication, stupor and respiratory depression can occur. Alcohol withdrawal (Choice B) causes anxiety, tremors, diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting, and hallucinations. Complicated alcohol withdrawal refers to a severe, life-threatening type of withdrawal that includes seizures or delirium tremens. Bipolar disorder (Choice C) is characterized by discrete episodes of depression and mania, which can sometimes be accompanied by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Tachycardia and excoriations would be uncommon, and primary psychiatric disorders are more frequently associated with auditory, rather than visual, hallucinations. Delusional disorder (Choice D) features one or more delusions for 1 month or longer with no other psychotic symptoms. This patient does not meet the duration criterion for delusional disorder and demonstrates disorganized behavior and vital sign abnormalities more consistent with methamphetamine intoxication. Generalized anxiety disorder (Choice E) features excessive and persistent worrying that may be associated with sympathetic hyperactivity. It would be unlikely to cause tactile or visual hallucinations and paranoia. Marijuana intoxication (Choice F) causes euphoria, paranoia, hallucinations, cognitive slowing, conjunctival injection, and dilated pupils. Patients withdrawing from marijuana (Choice G) experience irritability, anxiety, depression, insomnia, restlessness, and decreased appetite.

",C,"Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a cluster B personality disorder, the emotional or dramatic cluster, that arises from a deficit in empathy, resulting in pervasive violations of others' rights, aggression, and a hostile and manipulative attitude toward others (as in this patient's theft of her boyfriend's television set and her son's methylphenidate). Like other cluster B personality disorders, patients with ASPD struggle to regulate their emotions in that their frustration tolerance is low (as manifested in this patient's suicidality in the setting of a relatively minor stressor). They frequently behave impulsively. It is postulated that genetic polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene lead to deficient serotonin signaling and consequent dysphoria. Some studies have identified a higher-than-average rate of suicide among patients with ASPD, which may be related to their negative emotionality, hostility, and low restraint. These patients may also be chronically bored and hence sensation seeking, leading to a high rate of substance use (as manifested in this patient's rewarding feeling after taking methylphenidate) and gambling. These personality traits lead to deficits in personal (extreme egocentrism) and interpersonal (empathy, intimacy) functioning. Personality disorders are persistently maladaptive ways of relating to the self and to society that typically appear by early adulthood.","Acute intermittent porphyria (Choice A) presents after an acute metabolic stress (eg, starvation, alcohol ingestion) with psychosis (eg, hallucinations, delusions),abdominal pain, and burgundy-colored urine. This patient's aggression is caused by an absence of empathy, not psychosis.

Adjustment disorder with depressed mood (Choice B) refers to the onset of disproportionate distress, with predominant depressive symptoms, within 3 months of an identifiable stressor. This patient demonstrates a chronic and pervasive pattern of behavior that precedes the stressor of the argument.

Paranoid personality disorder (Choice D) is a cluster A personality disorder, the odd or eccentric cluster, characterized by a pervasive mistrust of others and viewing others as possessing malicious intent. This patient is unable to empathize with others but does not overtly mistrust others. As well, pervasive aggression is more consistent with ASPD.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (Choice E) consists of several affective and somatic symptoms occurring in the week before menses and resolving with the onset of menses. This patient does not demonstrate cyclicity of her symptoms. As well, her suicidality is occurring in the week after her menses.

Substance-induced mood disorder (Choice F) refers to depression symptoms secondary to substance use. This patient has taken her son's methylphenidate in the past but is not currently using substances.

Temporal lobe epilepsy (Choice G) presents with recurrent episodes of muscle spasms, sensory changes, or emotional/behavioral changes in the form of epileptic activity (seizures). This patient's emotional and behavioral changes are persistent and pervasive rather than episodic."

E) Pseudodementia secondary to major depressive disorder
",C,"Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) refers to a type of communicating (nonobstructive) hydrocephalus in which the ventricles are enlarged, leading to damage of the white matter tracts connecting the frontal lobes and basal ganglia. NPH typically presents in older patients with insidious onset of dementia (eg, frontal executive dysfunction), gait apraxia, and urinary incontinence. The gait apraxia may manifest as a wide-based or magnetic gait. The central vestibular tract, a white matter tract located in the periventricular area, may also be affected by ventriculomegaly, leading to this patient's postural instability. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema, postural headaches) are typically absent. Many cases of NPH are idiopathic though some are secondary to a defect in cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the ventricles due to scarring or obstruction of the ventricular lining from hemorrhage or meningitis. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, although ventriculomegaly on brain imaging is suggestive. Patients may improve rapidly in response to drainage of cerebrospinal fluid during a lumbar puncture (known as a positive lumbar tap test), which supports the diagnosis. Management commonly includes ventricular shunting for patients with a positive lumbar tap test.","Dementia, vascular type (Choice A), also known as multi-infarct dementia, presents with a stepwise decline in cognitive performance over several years and focal neurologic deficits. It occurs as a result of cumulative damage from many small ischemic strokes. X-rays often show evidence of microvascular disease. The gradual onset of this patient's decline as well as his gait changes and urinary symptoms are more suggestive of NPH.

Frontotemporal dementia (Choice B), also called Pick disease, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, causing deficits in social behavior or personality along with dementia. The onset of frontotemporal dementia is typically in the sixth decade of life. This patient does not demonstrate behavioral changes and is older than the typical demographic. Additionally, his gait and urinary symptoms are better explained by NPH.

Parkinson disease (Choice D) is a neurologic syndrome that features bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity (frequently associated with cogwheel phenomenon), and postural instability. Dementia is demonstrated late in the disease course, and this patient lacks most of the cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson disease.

Pseudodementia secondary to major depressive disorder (Choice E) can be observed in older patients, but this patient does not demonstrate adequate criteria needed for the diagnosis of depression, such as depressed mood, anhedonia, guilt, loss of energy, poor concentration, poor appetite, psychomotor retardation, or suicidal ideation."

When asked what he wants to be when he grows up, he says that he does not think he will grow up since he will probably die of a terminal illness first. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Adjustment disorder
B) Borderline personality disorder
C) Dissociative identity disorder
D) Histrionic personality disorder
E) Major depressive disorder
",E,"This patient meets criteria for major depressive disorder (MOD). MOD is characterized by 2 or more weeks of at least five of the following symptoms: depressed mood (or irritable mood in pediatric patients), anhedonia, guilt or worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, psychomotor slowing, suicidal thoughts, and/or neurovegetative symptoms (decreased energy, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance). Patients commonly demonstrate negativistic thinking about themselves, others, and/or the world. Symptoms disrupt everyday functioning (eg, declining grades and school avoidance in pediatric patients, home dysfunction, social withdrawal). Additional somatic symptoms such as stomachaches are common. Prominent mental status examination findings commonly include a depressed affect with a decreased affective range and latent and sparse speech. Patients with MOD should be carefully assessed for suicidal ideation. The most effective treatment for severe MOD (as in this patient) includes the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.","Adjustment disorder (Choice A) refers to the onset of disproportionate distress within 3 months of an identifiable stressor. It is commonly associated with depressive symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for MOD. This patient meets the diagnostic criteria of MOD.
Borderline personality disorder (Choice B) is a cluster B personality disorder, the emotional or dramatic cluster, that features emotional dysregulation, an unstable sense of self, and tumultuous relationships. Histrionic personality disorder (Choice D), a cluster B personality disorder, is characterized by theatrical, superficial expressions of emotion that unconsciously serve to garner attention from others to fulfill emotional needs. This patient is experiencing a consistently depressed mood, not a dysregulated/fluctuating mood or superficial emotions. As well, an official personality disorder diagnosis requires that the patient be 18 years old or older.
Dissociative identity disorder (Choice C), formerly known as multiple personality disorder, refers to patients transitioning between several identities and is frequently related to childhood trauma. This consistently depressed patient does not demonstrate multiple identities.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (Choice F) is an anxiety disorder that manifests with recurrent, intrusive urges or thoughts (obsessions) that the patient tries to relieve or neutralize by repetitive rituals (compulsions). Though this patient worries, he does not demonstrate compulsions. As well, his most prominent symptoms are depressive rather than anxious.
Psychoactive substance use disorder (Choice G) must meet at least two criteria, including an inability to cut back on a psychoactive substance, using more than expected, substances cravings, and persistent substance use despite negative social consequences. This patient does not demonstrate these symptoms.
In somatic symptom disorder (Choice H), the patient is excessively preoccupied with one or more somatic symptoms such that these symptoms disrupt daily life. This patient is not preoccupied with his stomachaches. Depressive symptoms most likely explain his school avoidance."
1668,"(qid: 1668) A 67-year-old man with a 2-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Treatment with the maximum dosage of proton pump inhibitors has not relieved his symptoms. He also has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. His only other medication is hydrochlorothiazide. His blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGO) shows grade Ill esophagitis and Barrett esophagus. A biopsy specimen of the esophagus shows mild dysplasia. He undergoes Nissen fundoplication, and his symptoms resolve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Continue proton pump inhibitor therapy
B) Repeat the EGO if the patient's symptoms recur
C) Repeat the EGO and biopsy in 6 months
D) Perform laser ablation of Barrett esophagus
E) No further treatment is indicated

",C,"Repeat the EGO and biopsy in 6 months is the most appropriate next step in management. Barret esophagus refers to intestinal metaplasia of squamous epithelium in the esophagus and is usually a consequence of prolonged gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERO), which occurs when acidic gastric contents reflux backward through the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) into the esophagus. The mucosa of the esophagus is comprised of squamous epithelium and does not traditionally encounter such an acidic environment. Constant exposure to acidic intraluminal contents induces a change in cell type from squamous epithelium to the columnar glandular epithelium found in the intestines as an adaptive response. Metaplasia can eventually lead to dysplasia, which is premalignant. Patients with confirmed Barrett esophagus should be evaluated at regular intervals determined by the presence and/or grade of dysplasia. This patient who has undergone Nissen fundoplication still requires follow up EGO in 6 months to assess for the presence of dysplasia. If dysplasia is still present, treatment involves ablation of the dysplastic cells via endoscopy.","Continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy alone (Choice A) is incorrect. The prior presence of esophageal dysplasia still requires follow-up EGO. Repeat the EGO in the patient's symptoms recur (Choice B) is incorrect. The presence of dysplasia on this patient's prior EGO necessitates a repeat EGO regardless of symptoms. Perform laser ablation of Barrett esophagus (Choice D) may be necessary if repeat EGO demonstrates dysplasia, but repeat EGO with biopsy is the initial requisite step. No further treatment is indicated (Choice E) is incorrect. This patient previously had dysplasia and requires follow-up EGO."
