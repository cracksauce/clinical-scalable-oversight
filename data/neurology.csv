",D,"An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow at a cerebral artery. Emboli can come from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. This patient has atrial fibrillation, which can predispose to an atrial thrombus that can embolize and cause an ischemic stroke. For this patient with atrial fibrillation, an anticoagulant would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to help prevent ischemic stroke. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the carboxylation of coagulation factors. This occurs through the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is necessary for recycling vitamin K, an essential cofactor in the synthesis of coagulation factors in the liver.","Atenolol (Choice A) is a Œ≤1-selective antagonist with greater activity at Œ≤1 receptors than Œ≤2 receptors. It is used in the treatment of hypertension, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Clopidogrel (Choice B) irreversibly binds to the adenosine diphosphate receptor on platelets (also called the P2Y12 receptor), which inhibits platelet aggregation. It also reduces expression of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa on the platelet surface. It is commonly used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and coronary artery stenting. Hydrochlorothiazide (Choice C) is an antihypertensive agent and a diuretic that inhibits sodium chloride reabsorption in the distal collecting tubule of the nephron. While hypertension is one of the most common risk factors for developing ischemic stroke, this patient's blood pressure is normal. Severe carotid atherosclerosis and stenosis can also be a cause of thromboembolic stroke. Carotid endarterectomy (Choice E) would be indicated for a patient with greater than 50% to 70% stenosis after a transient ischemic attack or nondisabling stroke. Current guidelines and recommendations may vary by society."

",D,"This patient's history of emphysema and smoking, as well as his signs and symptoms of decreased breath sounds at the left lung base, muscular weakness that improves with exertion, reduced deep tendon reflexes, and autonomic dysfunction (including dry mouth and erectile dysfunction) are concerning for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). LEMS is an uncommon neurologic condition involving formation of antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels at the neuromuscular junction, commonly as a paraneoplastic phenomenon in association with small cell lung carcinoma. Normally, voltage-gated calcium channels at the axonal terminal bouton open following depolarization, allowing calcium influx, and triggering exocytosis of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles into the synaptic cleft. In LEMS, antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels prevent terminal axonal calcium influx and release of acetylcholine to postsynaptic skeletal muscle cells. Patients classically display a triad of muscular weakness, depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes, and autonomic dysfunction. The muscle weakness and areflexia typically improve with exercise as amounts of acetylcholine accumulate in the synaptic cleft. Autonomic symptoms may include orthostasis, decreased salivation, dry eyes, and erectile dysfunction. Ocular and bulbar symptoms may occur later in the disease following onset of proximal muscle weakness and may include dysphagia, diplopia, and ptosis. The diagnosis is confirmed with nerve conduction studies and electromyography with exercise testing.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Choice A) is a genetic disorder that presents with slowly progressive, symmetric motor and sensory polyneuropathy that begins in the distal lower extremities, resulting in skeletal deformities such as hammer toes or pes cavus, and may progress to the upper extremities. Patients typically have a positive family history.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) (Choice B) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition affecting the proximal and distal muscles that presents with progressive muscle weakness and increased serum creatine kinase concentration. In contrast to other inflammatory myopathies that have a predilection for proximal muscles, distal weakness of the hands and ankles is a prominent and early finding. IBM does not typically present with autonomic dysfunction or areflexia and is not associated with lung carcinoma.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) (Choice C) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by the formation of inhibitory antiacetylcholine receptor autoantibodies. Common symptoms include muscular weakness, fatigue, diplopia, and ptosis that worsens toward the end of the day, along with dysphagia and potential respiratory distress. Patients may present with an associated thymoma. In contrast to LEMS, MG typically displays more prominent involvement of the upper extremities and earlier and more prominent ocular and bulbar findings. Autonomic dysfunction and areflexia are atypical of MG. In addition, muscular weakness in MG worsens, rather than improves, with repeated exertion.

Polymyositis (Choice E) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition affecting the proximal muscles. It is closely related to dermatomyositis; however, unlike dermatomyositis, it does not present with cutaneous findings. The muscular inflammation is characterized by endomysial CD8+ inflammatory infiltrate causing damage to the myocytes. Unlike LEMS, polymyositis typically presents with pain and stiffness of the affected muscles. Transient improvement in weakness with repeated exertion does not occur."

",A,"This patient demonstrates sleepwalking, a common parasomnia of childhood. Sleepwalking behaviors can range from intermittent quiet walking to frequently running around the house or behaving dangerously (eg, walking outside during a winternight). Polysomnography is indicated for dangerous sleepwalking or features suggestive of other comorbidities (eg, snoring suggestive of obstructinve sleep apnea as a trigger for sleepwalking). However, for patients with infrequent and non-dangerous episodes, reassurance is indicated. For patients who leave their bed, environmental safety measures should be taken (eg, clearing obstructions from bedroom floor, securing windows, placing the patient's mattress on the floor). The patient should not be restrained, as this may exacerbate sleep disturbance.","Recommending a later bedtime (Choice B) has not been shown to improve sleepwalking. Multiple sleep latency test (Choice C) assists in evaluating for narcolepsy. This patient does not demonstrate the intrusion of REM sleep phenomena (eg, cataplexy, hallucinations) into waking hours. Psychiatric assessment (Choice D) is not warranted. Sleepwalking is commonly an isolated symptom in healthy children. Diphenhydramine therapy (Choice E) has not been shown to improve sleepwalking. In severe cases, donazepam may be used."

",B,"This patient has a prior history of self-resolving numbness and presents with new hand numbness and a positive Lhermitte sign (electric shock-like sensation down the spine that occurs with neck flexion), which is consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS, the most prevalent immune-mediated demyelinating disease, may present with episodic or progressive focal neurologic dysfunction, including sensory loss, optic neuritis, weakness, bladder or bowel dysfunction, and/or cognitive impairment. Risk factors include female sex, white race, age between 20 to 40 years, residence in temperate climates, and ancestry (HLA-DR2 haplotype). According to the McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis, patients must have evidence of demyelinating lesions that are separated in time and location. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequences typically show white matter hyperintensities in the periventricular or subcortical white matter, cerebellum, or spine. Oligoclonal bands of immunoglobulins, indicating immune overactivation, can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid but are not necessary for diagnosis. Treatment includes corticosteroids for symptomatic management of acute flares and long-term disease-modifying treatments such as interferon or monoclonal antibodies. Cooling techniques (eg, cold drinks, lightweight clothing, air conditioning, ice packs, cooling suits) may improve heat-related exacerbations. Lifestyle modifications that apply to all patients, such as maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding excessive alcohol use, are also recommended for MS patients to decrease neuroinflammation.","Decreased postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor (Choice A) availability is seen in myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune condition caused by autoantibodies to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. Patients typically present with ptosis, facial weakness, difficulty swallowing, and proximal muscle weakness that is worse with repetitive use. Focal degeneration of peripheral sensory neurons (Choice C) can be seen in patients with peripheral neuropathy and presents most commonly with numbness and tingling of the extremities. Inflammation of cerebral arterioles (Choice D) is seen in patients with central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. CNS vasculitis can occur as a primary entity or secondary to an underlying autoimmune condition or systemic vasculitis. Patients with cerebral vasculitis may present with headache, confusion, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and possibly fevers. Meningeal inflammation (Choice E) is seen in patients with meningitis. These patients may present with headache, neck pain, fever, and confusion."

",D,"Acute low back pain lasts up to 4 weeks and may be associated with overuse or exertion. Clinically, patients may experience pain with movement and paraspinal tenderness in the absence of neurologic symptoms. Most cases will resolve with conservative management, which includes physical therapy, over-the-counter analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, massage, and heat therapy. Certain red flag signs and symptoms should trigger further evaluation, especially if there is concern for infection, malignancy, spinal cord compromise, or vertebral fracture. These include but are not limited to new fevers, intravenous drug use, focal neurologic deficits (eg, urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, bowel incontinence which may suggest myelopathy), progressive lower extremity neurologic symptoms, current or recent cancer history, advanced age, systemic corticosteroid use, and significant trauma. For this patient, the most appropriate next step in management includes physical therapy.","Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis (Choice A) is indicated for patients when there is concern for meningitis. Symptoms of meningitis include headache, neck stiffness, and fevers. Patients should be admitted to the hospital, undergo lumbar puncture, and be started on empiric antibiotics and/or antivirals, depending on the suspected cause of meningitis. MRI of the entire spine (Choice B) and X-ray of the lumbar spine (Choice E) should be reserved for patients who present with red flag signs and symptoms to evaluate for evidence of infection, malignancy, spinal cord compromise, or vertebral fracture. For otherwise healthy patients with back pain that has persisted for less than 4 weeks, imaging studies do not generally change management. Oxycodone therapy (Choice C) should be reserved for severe or refractory cases of acute low back pain. Opioids have not generally been shown to be effective in the management of musculoskeletal back pain and may create dependence along with hyperalgesia on withdrawal of the medication."

",B,"After decussating at the optic chiasm, retinal ganglion cell axons carrying information from the right visual field traverse the optic radiations and synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus. Neurons from the lateral geniculate nucleus travel to the primary visual cortex via the optic radiations. lesions rostral to the optic chiasm lead to ipsilateral deficits of one eye, whereas lesions caudal to the optic chiasm cause a contralateral visual field defect involving both eyes as in this patient. Thus, this patient's right visual field deficit is attributable to a left-sided area of dysfunction caudal to the optic chiasm. Migraine is a common condition that typically presents with recurrent primary headaches. Some patients experience an aura before or during the headache, which may present with a visual field defect followed by the perception of scintillating shapes or lines and/or paresthesia. For some patients, migraine auras occur in the absence of a headache. The pathophysiology of migraine aura involves the spread of cortical depolarization, the sequential depolarization of neurons, which typically originates in the occipital cortex. This depolarization produces visual field deficits.","left frontal cortex (Choice A) damage commonly leads to executive dysfunction, depression, motor, and/or speech abnormalities. Right frontal cortex (Choice E) damage typically presents with impulsivity, hypersexuality, and/or mania. If the frontal eye fields are damaged, patients can present with eye movement dysfunction. Visual field deficits are uncommon. Left and right retina (Choices C and G) dysfunction commonly leads to visual field deficits in one eye only. Migraine auras do not involve the retina. left or right temporal cortex (Choices D and H) lesions may interrupt the inferior branch of the optic radiations. They present with contralateral superior quadrantanopia, a visual defect described as a wedge-shaped loss of vision. Migraine auras originate in the occipital cortex, not the temporal cortex. The right occipital cortex (Choice F) would present with left visual field loss, not right."

E) Hepatic encephalopathy
",E,"Hepatic encephalopathy is commonly associated with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Signs of hepatic encephalopathy include confusion, stupor, asterixis, tremor, and myoclonus on physical examination. Hepatic encephalopathy results from accumulation of ammonia produced by colonic bacteria. Serum ammonia concentrations in patients with hepatic encephalopathy may be increased, though this is not necessary for the diagnosis. Treatments for hepatic encephalopathy include rifaximin and lactulose. Rifaximin is a gut-selective, nonabsorbable antibiotic with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It acts on the beta subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to inhibit bacterial synthesis and is bactericidal. Lactulose is degraded by colonic bacteria to create an acidic environment, thereby converting ammonia to ammonium, which cannot be readily absorbed across the gut wall. It is then excreted with feces, lowering total body levels.","Alcohol withdrawal (Choice A) presents with tremulousness, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and anxiety. Patients may also demonstrate autonomic instability. Delirium tremens is a life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal that presents with severe confusion, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability.

Expressive aphasia (Choice B), or Broca aphasia, is caused by injury to the Broca area within the frontal lobe of the brain. Patients with expressive (Broca) aphasia can comprehend language but have a difficult time forming sentences, connecting words, and producing speech.
Receptive aphasia (Choice C), or Wernicke aphasia, is caused by injury to the Wernicke area within the temporal lobe. Patients with receptive (Wernicke) aphasia can generate words and sounds but often cannot produce intelligible speech.
Dissociative fugue (Choice D) refers to a complete loss of memory associated with wandering behavior. This pattern of behavior may be seen in dissociative identity disorder or may be caused by a recent traumatic exposure.

Neurosyphilis (Choice F) typically presents with progressive dementia or tabes dorsalis (disease of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord). Delirium and asterixis would be atypical. Patients may demonstrate a tabetic gait (a wide-based, purposeful gait).
Wernicke encephalopathy (Choice G), caused by vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency, often in association with alcohol use disorder, is characterized by altered mental status, confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. This patient's condition is more consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and lacks consistent features of Wernicke encephalopathy. The diagnostic features may be difficult to distinguish clinically, and often patients will be jointly treated for both conditions."

",E,"Essential tremor is a common adult action tremor that most commonly presents as a bilateral tremor of the upper extremities. In general, action tremors are exacerbated by activity and sustained antigravity postures and improved by rest. Essential tremors specifically are exacerbated by stress and improved by small quantities of alcohol. The tremors may progressively involve more body regions over time, including the extremities, head, and voice. The pathogenesis of essential tremor is unknown, though it is commonly heritable. Propranolol and primidone are both effective first-line agents. Propranolol has fewer known drug-drug interactions and a better tolerated adverse effect profile. However, primidone, which is metabolized to phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide, is equally effective. Patients may respond to one drug and not the other.","Measure serum glucose and insulin concentrations (Choice A) is not likely to disclose useful information in this case. Hypoglycemia can present with autonomic symptoms, including tremor, palpitations, and agitation, as well as encephalopathy, weakness, seizure, and coma at severely low levels. This patient's presentation is much more consistent with essential tremor. Discontinue losartan (Choice B) or discontinue simvastatin (Choice C) are not necessary at this time. Numerous medications can increase a physiologic tremor, and drug-induced tremor is associated with antidepressants, antiepileptics, beta-agonists, and sympathomimetic agents, to name a few. Losartan and simvastatin do not have a strong association with tremor. Simvastatin can cause weakness and myalgias. Add carbidopa-levodopa to the medication regimen (Choice D) would be appropriate if the clinician has diagnosed Parkinson disease, as it is effective in controlling the characteristic resting tremor. This patient is presenting with an action tremor consistent with essential tremor, and first-line agents include propranolol and primidone."

",B,"A plantar fibroma is a benign growth of the underlying plantar fascia that may cause pain with ambulation and can be treated with surgical removal. The medial plantar nerve arises from the tibial nerve and, in association with the medial plantar artery, supplies the distal foot. Cutaneous branches of this nerve travel along and through the plantar aponeurosis supplying the medial plantar foot. Muscular branches supply the abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis, and lumbricals. Injury or laceration of this nerve, such as during removal of a plantar fibroma, will prevent flexion of the medial digits, as described in this case.","Hematoma in the dorsal interosseous muscles (Choice A) would result in overlying ecchymosis, swelling, and possibly inability to abduct the involved toes. This patient has a well healed scar and no significant swelling or ecchymosis, making the diagnosis of any significant hematoma unlikely. Neuroma of the saphenous nerve (Choice C) may result from injury of the saphenous nerve, which originates from the femoral nerve and may be injured during saphenous venous cutdown used in coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients would experience symptoms including loss of sensation of the medial leg. Stretch injury of the lateral plantar nerve (Choice D) may result in impaired sensation of the lateral foot and impaired function of the quadratus plantae and abductor digiti minimi muscles. Tendon injury of the flexor hallucis brevis muscle (Choice E) would impair flexion of the only great toe, required to push off during gait. This case involves the three medial digits, which would not support the diagnosis of flexor hallucis brevis injury."

",C,"Alcohol increases the central nervous system activity of Œ≥-aminobutyric acid, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Abrupt discontinuation of alcohol therefore leads to sympathetic (excitatory) excess. Uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal typically presents with tremors, anxiety, restlessness, headache, nausea, and diaphoresis, which can occur hours after the cessation of alcohol use. If left untreated, alcohol withdrawal can be complicated by seizures and alcoholic hallucinosis (auditory or visual hallucinations). Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, typically begins between 48 hours and 1 week after the patient's last drink. Presentation of delirium tremens includes severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual or auditory hallucinations, and autonomic instability. Alcohol withdrawal is managed supportively with benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam) to address agitation and prevent or treat the symptoms of withdrawal, along with fluids, nutritional supplementation, and frequent assessment including vital sign monitoring.","Alcoholic hallucinosis (Choice A) is characterized by visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations beginning 12 to 48 hours after the patient's last drink. Patients with alcoholic hallucinosis typically have normal vital signs and remain oriented, unlike this patient. Complex partial seizures (Choice B) are characterized by localized motor or sensory symptoms associated with loss of awareness during episodes. Korsakoff psychosis (Choice D) is characterized by anterograde and retrograde amnesia along with the consequent tendency to confabulate, or verbalize false stories or memories, to compensate for the inability to remember. Schizophrenia (Choice E) is a mental disorder characterized by psychosis, disorganized thoughts, and decline in functioning lasting longer than 6 months. Viral encephalitis (Choice F) typically presents with fever, headache, altered mental status, and neurologic abnormalities, such as seizure, aphasia, hemiparesis, or cranial nerve deficits. Although this patient does have a fever, the acute onset, tremor, and recent cessation of alcohol intake make delirium tremens more likely. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency (Choice G) presents with macrocytic anemia and associated, generalized symptoms of fatigue, pallor, and light-headedness. Deficiency may be found in patients with alcohol use disorder, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Crohn disease, or malabsorptive disorders."

",B,"Lewy body dementia is a common cause of degenerative dementia and is associated with the presence of eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions of alpha-synuclein called Lewy bodies. Lewy body dementia is associated with rapidly progressive dementia, with fluctuations in cognition, attention, and arousal. Additional symptoms include hallucinations and hypersomnia. Patients may have REM sleep behavior disorder, which is a loss of atonia during REM sleep. Patients may have parkinsonian features including bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and gait abnormalities. Patients with Lewy body dementia are treated symptomatically. Cognitive symptoms may be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, behavioral symptoms may respond to antipsychotics, and parkinsonian features may be treated with levodopa therapy.","Frontotemporal dementia (Choice A) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, causing deficits in social behavior or personality along with dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is not as generally associated with parkinsonian features including shuffling gait, posture abnormalities, or cogwheel rigidity.
Multiple system atrophy (Choice C) is associated with predominant parkinsonism or ataxia, and autonomic failure, such as urinary dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, anhidrosis, erectile dysfunction, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Most patients have intact cognition. This patient's symptoms are not suggestive of multiple system atrophy.
Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (Choice D) is associated with the triad of cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, and gait instability. Such symptoms should raise concern for normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Initial evaluation should include neuroimaging and a lumbar puncture to assess the patient's opening pressure and clinical response to the removal of cerebrospinal fluid.
Parkinson disease (Choice E) presents with dysfunction of voluntary movements in the form of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Dementia may occur late in the disease course, but motor symptoms are predominant in Parkinson disease.
Progressive supranuclear palsy (Choice F), an atypical parkinsonian disorder, is a neurodegenerative disease related to tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles in the basal ganglia, cortex, and brainstem. Patients typically present at an average age of 65 years with gait instability, oculomotor deficits (eg, vertical gaze palsy), frontal lobe deficits, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity.
Wernicke encephalopathy (Choice G), caused by vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency, most often in association with alcohol use disorder, is characterized by altered mental status, confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia."

",B,"In degenerative disc disease or disc herniation, pressure on the spinal nerve roots leads to back pain and paresthesia, numbness, pain, and/or weakness of the lower extremities. One of the most common areas of involvement is the L5 nerve root, which typically presents with back pain that radiates down the lateral aspect of the leg into the foot. Strength is decreased in dorsiflexion, toe extension, and foot inversion and aversion. Sensory loss is confined to the lower leg and dorsum of the foot. Diagnosis may be made clinically, or with the assistance of electromyography or MRI. Patients may benefit from a trial of anti-inflammatories as well as physical therapy. Patients with severe disease may benefit from surgical consultation.","Cerebral hemisphere (Choice A) involvement of the primary motor cortex in the case of cerebrovascular accidents may present with upper motor neuron symptoms including weakness or loss of sensation, over time developing spasticity, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. This patient's symptoms most likely represent lower motor neuron involvement.
Lumbosacral plexus (Choice C) compression may result in cauda equina syndrome. Compression may result from malignancy, trauma, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spinal epidural abscess, or spinal hematoma. Symptoms include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, hyporeflexia, perineal anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by inability to void and urinary retention. Emergent MRI of the lumbosacral spine is indicated to investigate the cause of cauda equina syndrome and to determine the necessity of surgical decompression.
Peripheral nerve (Choice D) injury, such as the fibular (peroneal) nerve, may be the result of fibular head fracture. Patients may present with pain, sensory changes, and footdrop; however, these patients would not experience referred pain from the buttocks.
Spinal cord (Choice E) compression such as conus medullaris syndrome can also present with sphincter dysfunction, spastic or flaccid paralysis, and saddle anesthesia in addition to lower extremity weakness. Weakness in isolation would be less likely."

",A,"Atrial fibrillation can be recognized on ECG as an irregular, narrow-complex arrhythmia lacking distinct P waves. Uncoordinated atrial contractions and tachycardia result in diminished left ventricular filling during diastole, which results in a decreased cardiac output. Atrial fibrillation can also lead to a formation of a thrombus in the atrium. When a thrombus or clot breaks off and travels to the brain, blood flow can be occluded at a cerebral artery, causing an embolic ischemic stroke. For this patient with atrial fibrillation, an anticoagulant would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to help prevent ischemic stroke. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the carboxylation of coagulation factors. This occurs through the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is necessary for recycling vitamin K, an essential cofactor in the synthesis of coagulation factors in the liver.","Adding an antiplatelet agent such as aspirin (Choice B) or another anticoagulant such as heparin (Choice C) would not result in significant additional protection against ischemic stroke and would unnecessarily increase the risk for bleeding. Patients are typically placed on one anticoagulant medication to prevent cerebrovascular morbidity in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Dipyridamole (Choice D) is a phosphodiesterase III (PDE3) inhibitor that reduces the degradation of cAMP in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in the inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation. An anticoagulant such as warfarin is more appropriate in helping prevent clot formation and embolization in atrial fibrillation. Sulfinpyrazone (Choice E) is a medication used in the treatment of gout. It would not be helpful in the prevention of clot formation in atrial fibrillation."

",B,"The median nerve supplies motor fibers to the majority of the muscles of the anterior forearm, along with muscles in the thenar eminence and the first two lumbrical muscles. It transmits sensory input from the anterior palm, the anterior and distal aspects of digits one through three plus the radial aspect of digit four. It supplies motor fibers to the radial half of the flexor digitorum profundus. The median nerve can be injured in the setting of a supracondylar humerus fracture, carpal tunnel syndrome in the wrist, or laceration along its course. A median nerve injury can cause symptoms depending on the location of the lesion, causing palsy distal to the injury. In this patient, injury at the antecubital elbow region would cause symptoms in the forearm and hand. Median nerve palsy can result in impaired wrist flexion, thumb opposition, or flexion of the lateral fingers, and impaired sensation to the anterior forearm, thenar eminence, and volar and dorsal-distal aspects of the lateral three and a half fingers.","The anterior interosseous nerve (Choice A) is a branch of the median nerve. It is a purely motor nerve and supplies the flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus muscles of the forearm, along with the pronator quadratus. It does not supply any muscles of the arm or sensory innervation. Compression of the median nerve at the intercarpal canal (Choice C), also known as carpal tunnel syndrome, would initially lead to pain and paresthesia in the first three digits and may progress to hand weakness. Sensory or motor symptoms of the forearm and arm would be atypical, as the forearm would not be affected. The posterior interosseous nerve (Choice D) innervates the extensor pollicis brevis and extensor pollicis longus muscles that function for thumb extension. Compression of the ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel (Choice E), also called cubital tunnel syndrome, could result in numbness or paresthesia in the medial hand and forearm. Compression of the ulnar nerve at the wrist (Choice F) in Guyon canal could result in loss of sensation over the medial hand."

",E,"Surrogate decision-makers (eg, legal guardian, durable power of attorney, or legal next of kin) are responsible for medical decision-making for patients who lack capacity, as in this case. The use of enteral tube feeding in patients with advanced dementia has been found consistently not to result in prolongation of life or increased quality of life and may result in harmful complication related to aspiration pneumonia, tube dogging or dislodgement, infection, and skin ulceration. Despite this evidence, enteral tube feeding is still often offered to patients with advanced dementia, particularly when a particular patient's surrogate decision-maker or family members favor aggressive intervention. Family members who request invasive interventions during end-of-life care often may not understand the invasive nature and potential complications of the requested intervention. When family members request an intervention that is not beneficial and may be harmful, a thoughtful and empathetic discussion of the risks and lack of benefits is most appropriate.","Consulting with the hospital ethics committee (Choice A) may be necessary when a patient's surrogate decision-maker is requesting intervention that is inappropriate or is refusing recommended treatment. This is not yet necessary in this case. Ultimately, the physician has an ethical obligation of nonmaleficence and may eventually choose to involve the hospital ethics committee if the surrogate decision-maker insists on an intervention that the physician believes is harmful. Placing the tube and beginning enteral nutrition (Choice B) is inappropriate given the lack of demonstrated benefit in this population. Refusing to have the tube placed because of the surgical risk involved (Choice C) is incorrect. While there are a variety of compelling medical and ethical reasons to avoid tube feeding for this patient, outright refusal from the physician is not helpful and is not sensitive to the daughter's motives for pursuing this intervention. Requesting written documentation of the daughter's power of attorney (Choice D) is not necessary at this time and may lead to a confrontation. As discussed above, a review of the potential risks and benefits of enteral nutrition is more appropriate and likely to dissuade the daughter from this intervention."

",C,"Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication with many cytochrome P450 (CYP) system interactions and adverse effects. These adverse effects may occur at therapeutic serum concentrations but are commonly dose-dependent and mediated by toxic serum concentrations secondary to a narrow therapeutic window. This patient's phenytoin concentration likely increased due to the inhibition of CYP-2C19 by fluoxetine (in the setting of substance use leading to irregular fluoxetine administration patterns). Common adverse effects include neurotoxicity (eg, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia secondary to cerebellar atrophy, lethargy) and fibroblast stimulation leading to gingival hyperplasia, coarse facies, and hirsutism. Less commonly, phenytoin can cause cardiac arrhythmias, megaloblastic anemia, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This patient's serum phenytoin concentration should be measured. If increased, phenytoin should be discontinued and, if severely increased, hemodialysis should be considered.","Measurement of serum fluoxetine concentration (Choice A) is less likely to be helpful. Fluoxetine toxicity is more likely to present with serotonin syndrome and/or cardiotoxicity than neurotoxicity.
Measurement of serum sodium concentration (Choice B) is unnecessary. Hyponatremia symptoms include nausea and vomiting, anorexia, headache, and muscle cramps. If severe, seizures and confusion may occur. Ataxia, diplopia, and nystagmus would be uncommon.
EEG (Choice D) assists in diagnosing seizure. This patient does not demonstrate tonic or clonic motor activity nor symptoms that would otherwise be consistent with seizure.
MRI of the brain (Choice E) is commonly used to investigate the cause of acute neurologic changes. However, MRI is unnecessary for this patient at this time as there is a likely explanation for her neurologic changes."

",D,"Dizziness and gait instability carries a broad differential diagnosis, and is often divided into central, peripheral, and secondary causes of symptoms to determine a likely diagnosis. Central causes include cerebrovascular accidents such as ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, tumors of the brainstem and cerebellum, infarction involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and multiple sclerosis or similar demyelinating disorders. Peripheral causes include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, endolymphatic fistula, or temporal bone fractures, tumors, or lesions. Secondary or systemic causes can include electrolyte imbalances, hypovolemia, cardiac arrhythmia, infections, and vitamin deficiencies, among other causes. This patient likely has labyrinthitis, an inflammation of the inner ear, often involving the vestibulocochlear nerve and often preceded by an upper respiratory or ear infection. Classic symptoms include vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hearing loss. Treatment is supportive, along with the exclusion of emergent causes of vertigo and ataxia, as the condition is typically self-limited.","A disorder affecting the acoustic nerve (Choice A), such as an acoustic neuroma, presents with gradual onset of hearing loss and can be associated with an insidious (not sudden) onset of vestibular dysfunction.

A disorder involving the cerebellum (Choices B and E), such as an ischemic stroke, would also result in vomiting, vertigo, and nystagmus, but nystagmus would be multidirectional or gaze-evoked nystagmus, which changes direction according to the patient's gaze. Neurologic examination for patients with ischemic stroke of the cerebellum would also show other abnormalities such as truncal and/or appendicular ataxia or dysarthria.

An infarct in the medulla oblongata (Choice C) can lead to lateral medullary syndrome, which can present with ipsilateral ataxia of extremity movements, gait ataxia, Horner syndrome, and can be associated with nystagmus and dysarthria."

",E,"Patients with alcohol use disorder typically show a significant vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency due to poor nutritional intake, thiamine malabsorption, and impaired cellular utilization of thiamine. Over time, thiamine deficiency can result in damage and atrophy of the mammillary bodies, visible on MRI of the brain, which manifests as Wernicke encephalopathy. To prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, all patients with sustained heavy alcohol use should be given oral thiamine supplementation, and patients presenting with acute intoxication should generally be given parenteral thiamine. The typical clinical presentation of Wernicke encephalopathy is a triad of acutely altered mental status, ophthalmoplegia (along with nystagmus), and ataxia. The symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy are reversible but increase the risk for developing Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in chronic alcohol users if not immediately treated with high-dose parenteral thiamine. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is an irreversible condition that features psychosis, anterograde and retrograde amnesia, and the consequent tendency to confabulate, or verbalize false stories or memories, to compensate for the inability to remember.","Azithromycin (Choice A) is a typical treatment for community-acquired atypical pneumonia. While infection is a common cause of delirium, the presence of nystagmus and ataxia is more suggestive of Wernicke encephalopathy as the cause of this patient's altered mental status.
Chlordiazepoxide (Choice B) is a benzodiazepine medication most used for alcohol withdrawal. Uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal presents with tremors, anxiety, restlessness, headache, nausea, and diaphoresis. Alcohol withdrawal may progress to delirium tremens, characterized by severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability.
Folic acid (Choice C) is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and is used as a coenzyme in the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleosides. Folic acid is contained in leafy vegetables and absorbed in the jejunum. Folic acid deficiency is often seen in patients with malnutrition, alcohol use disorder, and those taking antifolate medications (eg, phenytoin, methotrexate).
Selenium (Choice D) is useful for the treatment of thyroid eye disease but plays no role in the prevention of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) (Choice F) deficiency results in peripheral neuropathy and impaired proprioception from subacute combined degeneration of the dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Patients also frequently demonstrate macrocytic anemia, which is not present in this case.
Zinc (Choice G) deficiency may be present in patients with alcohol use disorder and causes acrodermatitis. Zinc deficiency does not typically produce neurologic symptoms such as ataxia or nystagmus."

D) Peripheral neuropathy
E) Normal aging
",E,"This patient has physical examination findings consistent with normal aging. Normal aging includes a slow decline of executive functioning, attention span, and problem-solving after age 70 years. The central nervous system is affected greatly by the aging process, and there are characteristic findings consistent with normal aging that every physician should be familiar with. One of the most common neurologic changes to occur is the loss of vibratory sensation, primarily in the distal extremities, as seen in this patient. Other findings include decreased to absent deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) (especially in the ankle), decreased pupillary response to light, presbyopia, and decreased hearing. As a patient ages, their gait often becomes broad-based and their stride shortens. Changes associated with sleep include a decrease in REM sleep and sleep onset latency, and an increase in nighttime awakenings. It is crucial for physicians to be familiar with these changes and be able to distinguish them from pathologic findings.","Cervical myelopathy (Choice A) refers to compression of the cervical portion of the spinal cord, most commonly caused by degenerated vertebral bodies, facet joints, and/or herniated intervertebral discs. Motor weakness with lower motor neuron findings at the level of degenerative compression are accompanied by upper motor neuron findings below the level of the compression. Symptoms are most predominant in the upper extremities. Lumbar spinal stenosis (Choice B) refers to the narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal, which results in compression of the lumbar nerve roots or spinal cord. Patients classically present with low back pain that radiates to the buttocks and lower extremities that worsens with spinal extension and improves with spinal flexion. Patients may exhibit weakness and decreased DTRs on examination. Osteoarthritis (Choice C) is a common degenerative condition that is found primarily in elderly patients and frequently affects the weight-bearing joints of the hip or knee. Pain is often worse at the end of the day and after activity. Osteoarthritis does not cause decreased DTRs or decreased sensation. Peripheral neuropathy (Choice D) has many causes, including metabolic, toxic, autoimmune, and/or hereditary neuropathy. Symptoms include paresthesia or pain, and extremity weakness in a ""stocking glove"" distribution."

B) Cauda equina syndrome
C) Pelvic fracture
D) Pudendal nerve injury
E) Tibial nerve injury
",B,"Cauda equina syndrome occurs as a result of compression of the spinal nerve roots comprising the cauda equina. Often, such compression occurs due to malignancy, trauma (eg, compression fractures with fragment retropulsion), disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spinal epidural abscess, or spinal epidural or subdural hematoma. Symptoms include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, hyporeflexia, perineal anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by an inability to void and urinary retention. Emergent MRI of the lumbosacral spine is indicated to investigate the cause of cauda equina syndrome and to determine the necessity of surgical decompression. Initial treatment for patients with epidural spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits includes symptomatic treatment, pain control, and glucocorticoid therapy prior to operative therapy. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy is helpful as a bridge to definitive therapy, can help control pain, and may transiently improve neurologic function secondary to decreasing edema at the site of cord compression.","Direct blunt abdominal trauma to the lower abdomen or pelvis can cause bladder rupture and urine leakage into the abdominopelvic cavity. Bladder injuries (Choice A) are commonly associated with pelvic fractures (Choice C). Patients with bladder injuries may present with gross hematuria, suprapubic tenderness, difficulty urinating, or peritonitis from irritation by intraperitoneal urine. The pudendal nerve supplies the perineum and genitourinary organs. It is a primary sensory afferent from the external genitalia, the skin of the anus, and the perineum. Pudendal nerve injury (Choice D) would result in numbness of the genitalia and perineum but would not lead to incontinence or lower extremity weakness. The tibial nerve supplies motor innervation to the posterior compartment of the lower leg and the intrinsic muscles of the foot and supplies sensation to the plantar surface of the foot. A tibial nerve injury (Choice E) would compromise strength of toe flexion and ankle plantar flexion."

B) Drop attack
C) Herpes simplex
D) Seizure disorder
E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage
F) Transient ischemic attack
G) Vasovagal syncope
",G,"Syncope is a common presenting finding with numerous causes. Vasovagal syncope is caused by a disordered autonomic nervous system response with increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic activity. This results in an acute decrease in peripheral vascular resistance with simultaneous bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, and an inability to maintain perfusion to the brain. Symptoms often follow a specific trigger such as standing for long periods of time, heat, intense emotion, the sight of blood, or pain. The onset of symptoms is typically gradual over several seconds and associated with nausea, light-headedness, dizziness, visual disturbances, pallor, and/or diaphoresis. A careful history that evaluates for provoking factors and physical examination can guide further diagnostic studies and is essential for differentiating vasovagal syncope from other potential causes of syncope, such as cardiac syncope, seizure, hypoglycemia, or transient ischemic attack. The diagnosis is clinical, although a diagnostic evaluation is often performed to exclude other diagnoses. Tilt testing may reproduce vasovagal symptoms and is helpful when the diagnosis is uncertain. For most patients, avoidance of risk factors is the only necessary treatment.","Carcinoid syndrome (Choice A) is a rare disorder that results from the production of serotonin by a carcinoid tumor. Symptoms include weight loss, flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, right-sided cardiac valvular disease, and abdominal pain. Flushing and bronchospasm are typically episodic, though the other symptoms are constant and not found in this patient.

Drop attack (Choice B) is a nonspecific term that refers to a sudden fall without an associated loss of consciousness, which may occur for a variety of neurologic, vascular, or orthopedic reasons.

Herpes simplex (Choice C) is a common cause of viral meningitis, which presents with fever, headache, obtundation, seizures, and meningismus.

Seizure disorders (Choice D) are variable in presentation but typically present with the sudden onset of muscle contractions followed by rhythmic jerking of the extremities. Bowel and/or bladder incontinence commonly occurs. Episodes are accompanied by a postictal state marked by confusion and fatigue. Preceding symptoms of light-headedness and flushing, as well as the presence of sinus bradycardia, are more consistent with vasovagal syncope.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (Choice E) presents with acute, severe headache, fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, and possible stupor or coma. The absence of headache in this patient suggests an alternate diagnosis.

Transient ischemic attack (Choice F) is a transient episode of focal neurologic dysfunction caused by central nervous system ischemia without infarction. The focal symptoms last less than 24 hours by definition and may last as little as a few minutes. This patient's brief symptoms with complete resolution and absence of sequelae or risk factors suggest against the diagnosis."

B) Cortical vein
C) Middle cerebral artery
D) Middle meningeal artery
E) Superior sagittal sinus
F) Transverse sinus
",A,"Shearing of the bridging veins in the subdural space is the cause of subdural hematoma (SDH). Head trauma, the use of anticoagulants, physical abuse, alcohol use disorder, cerebral atrophy, and malignancy are associated with an increased risk for SDH. On imaging, SDH appears as a crescent-shaped collection abutting the internal surface of the skull, not bound by suture lines. In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress adjacent brain parenchyma, displacing the cerebral hemisphere. Thus, presentation can include subacute-onset headache, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, herniation syndromes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure such as vomiting and papilledema. Patients may manifest upper motor neuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign). Elderly patients are at risk for cerebral atrophy, which places traction on bridging cortical veins. In this setting, minor trauma such as falls can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. Untreated, the SDH may continue to grow. The intracranial compartment is a fixed space within a rigid skull; pathologic lesions such as SDH can result in midline shift and herniation of central nervous system structures if large enough. When such mass effect is present or at risk for developing, surgical interventions such as decompressive burr holes or a craniotomy may be indicated to evacuate the hematoma.","Cortical veins (Choice B), which drain the bridging veins, are rarely directly injured in head trauma. A more likely pathology in this structure is cortical venous thrombosis, usually in conjunction with dural venous sinus thrombosis. It is diagnosed via filling defects in the sinuses on CT venography.
Middle cerebral artery (Choice C) traumatic injury is rare; deficits are more often seen in the setting of stroke. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery leads to contralateral hemiparesis and contralateral sensory deficit of the face and upper extremities. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery supplying the dominant hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere) leads to aphasia, while occlusion of the middle cerebral artery supplying the nondominant hemisphere results in hemineglect.
Middle meningeal artery (Choice D) trauma is associated with epidural hematomas, which can present with an initial lucid interval followed by rapid deterioration of mental status as a result of arterial bleeding and hematoma expansion. Visual deficits can occur in the setting of uncal herniation, which compresses the oculomotor nerve and causes pupillary dilation, ptosis, and inferior and lateral deviation of the pupil.
Superior sagittal sinus (Choice E) injury is the most common dural sinus injury seen in head trauma; however, the location of this patient's head strike does not correlate with its anatomic location. Transverse sinus (Choice F) injury is rare. Dural venous sinus injuries tend to present more acutely than indolent SDHs and require prompt surgical intervention. The risks for mortality and sequelae such as dural venous sinus thrombosis are high."

B) Benign positional vertigo
C) Carotid stenosis
D) Thalamic infarction
E) Vertebrobasilar insufficiency
",E,"Vertebrobasilar insufficiency is often caused by atherosclerosis leading to decreased posterior circulation, most commonly at or near the vertebrobasilar artery junction. Symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency can include vertigo, light-headedness, dysequilibrium, ataxia, and nystagmus (due to transiently decreased blood supply to the vestibular nuclei). Patients can have difficulty walking or lean while standing upright without support (Romberg sign). Upper motor neuron signs such as hyperreflexia and Babinski sign point to a central cause of this patient's vertigo. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency can be transient, such as with a transient ischemic attack, or cause infarction of the lateral medulla. Patients can also present with loss of pain and temperature sensation of the ipsilateral face and contralateral extremities.","Acoustic neuroma (Choice A) presents with symptoms of hearing loss, vertigo, and ataxia, often slow in onset and progressive over a subacute to chronic period. Acoustic neuromas may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves, resulting in facial asymmetry and/or diminished hearing or tinnitus. Bilateral hyperreflexia and Babinski sign are more suggestive of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.

Benign positional vertigo (Choice B) is a common cause of vertigo that occurs due to a calcium carbonate particle (otoconium) that gets displaced from the otolith organs into the adjacent semicircular canals, leading to the erroneous sensation of position change. Patients typically present with episodic vertigo with nystagmus, nausea, and normal hearing. Since it is a peripheral cause of vertigo, patients would not have upper motor neuron signs suggestive of a central cause of vertigo.

Carotid stenosis (Choice C) can cause decreased flow to the brain or embolic events causing cerebrovascular ischemia. Patients can have a carotid bruit on examination.

Thalamic infarction (Choice D) such as with an ischemic stroke can cause specific neurologic deficits depending on which thalamic nuclei are involved, including visual deficits, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and/or language deficits. It is not typically associated with vertigo.

Vestibulitis (Choice F) is an idiopathic localized vulvar pain syndrome, also known as vulvodynia. It is not associated with neurologic deficits. Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the vestibulocochlear nerve, resulting in peripheral vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and gait instability. It is usually preceded by a viral illness and does not typically cause hearing loss."

",E,"Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory condition characterized by proximal muscle and joint (e.g., shoulder and hip girdle) pain, stiffness, and increased inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. If untreated, muscle weakness may occur from disuse atrophy. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue are commonly noted. It is most common in patients over age 60 years, and some patients have associated temporal arteritis. Signs of temporal arteritis such as throbbing temporal headache, vision changes, or jaw claudication should prompt temporal artery biopsy. The diagnosis of PMR is based on clinical features, and treatment is with prednisone for up to 1 year. It is common for patients to respond to prednisone almost immediately; thus, the absence of response should prompt consideration of a different diagnosis.","Azathioprine (Choice A) is a purine analogue commonly used as an immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation and inflammatory conditions. Adverse effects include hepatotoxicity and leukopenia, as well as headaches, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is not used in the treatment of PMR. Colchicine (Choice B) is used to treat inflammatory arthritis and pericarditis and is classically used in the treatment of gout. It inhibits microtubule formation, thereby preventing white blood cell translocation into the joint, which limits joint space inflammation and associated arthropathy.

",A,"Fibrocystic changes of the breast occur most commonly in premenopausal women. Patients may present with various sites of breast pain and lumps, which may be bilateral. The condition is characterized by the presence of cysts, stromal fibrosis, and apocrine metaplasia on histology, and is believed to occur in response to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. Reexamination after menses (eg, day 9 of the next menstrual cycle) may be helpful for diagnosis because the size of fibrocystic changes should subside after menses, distinguishing it from other causes. On examination, the cysts may appear blue. Fibrocystic change is a benign disease and does not generally convey an increased risk for cancer except for certain subtypes; however, it can result in recurrent mastalgia. If there is associated discomfort, aspiration can be performed, which may relieve symptoms. Cyst aspiration can yield fluid that is clear, milky, yellow, green, or brown, which are all benign. Supportive care is also appropriate, using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a well-fitting bra.","Measurement of serum prolactin concentration (Choice B) is useful in the evaluation of galactorrhea and menstrual cycle irregularities (eg, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea) because of its inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Galactorrhea refers to milky discharge from one or both nipples, which this patient is not experiencing.
Mammography (Choice C) is most used as a screening modality to detect early stages of breast cancer, although it may also be used to aid in the diagnosis of a palpable breast mass. However, ultrasonography is more commonly used to aid in diagnosis for patients under age 35 years, as their breast tissue is often too dense to be adequately evaluated with mammography.
Ultrasonography of the breasts (Choice D) is frequently used in the evaluation of breast lesions for patients under age 35 years. It can determine the need for fine-needle aspiration (eg, breast cyst) or further imaging. This patient has no palpable breast lump, which would make ultrasonography ineffective in evaluating her symptoms. If performed, it would likely show multiple small cystic lesions.
MRI of the breasts (Choice E) may be used for the evaluation of a breast lump in patients under age 35 years, but it is more commonly reserved for evaluation of patients with breast implants or those with a high risk for developing breast cancer (eg, BRCA mutation carriers). This patient may require additional imaging in the future, but she should first have a repeat examination on day 9 of her next menstrual cycle."
